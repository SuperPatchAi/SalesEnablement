I know DCs are already committed to non-invasive care, and I wanted to share a technology that's been clinically studied for pain relief. Do you have two minutes, or would scheduling a brief call work better?",

Our Freedom patch uses Vibrotactile Technology, a drug-free approach that works with the body's own neural pathways. The RESTORE study showed significant pain reduction and improved range of motion."

First, wholesale with a 25% practitioner discount where you purchase patches and retail directly to patients. Second, an affiliate program where we provide you a unique referral link, patients order directly from us, and you earn commission with no inventory to manage. Or third, a hybrid approach where you stock key products like Freedom and REM for immediate sale and use affiliate for the full product line. Which model sounds like it would fit best with how you run your practice?"

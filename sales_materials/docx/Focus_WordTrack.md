### 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION SCRIPT

**Framework:** Problem-Agitate-Solve (approx. 2 minutes)

"Thanks for sharing that, [Customer Name]. It sounds like [reiterate their key pain point, e.g., 'that mid-afternoon brain fog'] is a real challenge for you, and I completely get it.

**(Problem)** Do you ever find yourself struggling to concentrate, feeling that frustrating brain fog, or getting easily sidetracked when you really need to be sharp and productive?

**(Agitate)** It's incredibly frustrating, isn't it? That feeling when deadlines loom, or you're trying to study for an important exam, and your mind just won't cooperate. You end up wasting precious time, feeling less accomplished, and sometimes even a bit overwhelmed by the sheer volume of things demanding your attention. And often, the solutions out there either involve caffeine jitters and energy crashes, or they're just not natural, leaving you wondering about long-term effects and what you're actually putting into your body. It can feel like a constant uphill battle just to stay on top of your game.

**(Solve)** Well, what if there was a simple, elegant, and 100% drug-free way to naturally bolster your mind's concentration and attention? That's exactly what the Super Patch Focus patch is designed to do. It leverages our unique Vibrotactile Technology (VTT) – these specialized ridge patterns on the patch interact with your skin's mechanoreceptors to gently trigger your body's own neural responses, guiding your brain towards better concentration, improved attention, and profound mental clarity. It's like giving your brain a natural 'on' switch, helping you stay sharp and productive without any drugs, chemicals, or invasiveness. You just peel it, stick it on your skin, and start feeling the difference. Imagine tackling your day with that kind of sustained focus!"

### 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

**Framework:** Conversation Aikido (Acknowledge and Understand + Redirect with an Open Question)

#### 1. "It's too expensive."
"I understand that money is an important factor when you're considering new wellness solutions, and it's smart to be mindful of your budget. What other criteria will be used in taking this decision, beyond just the initial cost?"

#### 2. "I need to think about it."
"I understand this is an important decision for your mental clarity and productivity, and you want to ensure it's the right fit for your lifestyle. What specific questions or considerations are on your mind as you think it over?"

#### 3. "I need to talk to my spouse."
"I understand this is a significant decision for your household and your well-being, and you want to ensure everyone is on board. What aspects of improving your focus and productivity do you think would be most important for your spouse to understand or discuss?"

#### 4. "Does it really work? It sounds too good to be true."
"I completely understand why you might be skeptical about new technologies, and it's important to feel confident in your choices. What would you need to see, hear, or experience to truly feel that this is a credible solution for you?"

#### 5. "I've tried patches/products before, and they didn't work."
"I understand you've explored different solutions in the past, and it's natural to be cautious when something hasn't delivered. What did you like or dislike about those previous patches or products, and what specific results were you hoping for that weren't met?"

#### 6. "I'm not interested."
"I understand you might not be actively looking for something new right now, and that's perfectly fine. What aspects of your current focus and productivity are you most satisfied with, or what challenges, if any, do you find yourself just 'living with'?"

#### 7. "I don't have time."
"I understand you have a very busy schedule, and that's completely fair. What specific challenges around time management or productivity are you facing right now that make it difficult to explore solutions to boost your focus?"

#### 8. "How is this different from [competitor product/caffeine/nootropic]?"
"I understand you're looking for the best solution out there, and it's smart to compare options. What aspects of [competitor product/caffeine/nootropic] are most appealing to you, and what are you hoping to achieve that might be different or better with a new approach?"

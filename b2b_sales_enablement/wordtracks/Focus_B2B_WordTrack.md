## 1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW (Clinical Focus)

**Focus** is Super Patch's drug-free concentration support solution, designed to bolster attention and mental clarity through Vibrotactile Technology (VTT). Focus works by activating neural pathways associated with attention and cognitive function without stimulants or nootropics.

### Clinical Mechanism of Action

Focus's VTT works through evidence-based mechanisms:
- **Neural Pathway Activation:** Stimulates attention-related mechanoreceptor pathways
- **Cognitive Support:** Enhances focus and mental clarity through neural modulation
- **Non-Stimulant Approach:** No dopamine/norepinephrine flooding like pharmaceutical stimulants
- **Sustained Attention:** Supports concentration without peaks and crashes

### Key Differentiators vs. Focus Medications/Supplements

| Feature | Stimulant Medications | Nootropics/Supplements | VTT (Focus) |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Mechanism | Dopamine/norepinephrine | Various | Neural pathway activation |
| Controlled Substance | Yes (Schedule II) | No | **No** |
| Dependency Risk | High | Variable | **None** |
| Side Effects | Appetite, sleep, mood | Variable | **Minimal** |
| Cardiovascular Risk | Elevated | Possible | **None** |
| Appropriate for All Ages | Limited | Variable | **Yes** |

### Practice Integration Benefits
- **Non-Prescription Alternative:** For mild-moderate attention concerns
- **Adjunct to Therapy:** Supports focus during behavioral interventions

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION SCRIPT (2-Minute)

**(Problem-Agitate-Solve-Evidence Framework)**

**(PROBLEM)**

"Focus and attention challenges are reaching epidemic levels – affecting children in school, adults at work, and aging patients trying to maintain cognitive function. Yet the treatment options create difficult choices.

Stimulant medications work, but they're controlled substances with significant side effects: appetite suppression, sleep disruption, mood changes, cardiovascular concerns, and dependency risk. Many patients can't tolerate them, and many parents are understandably hesitant about putting their children on them."

**(AGITATE)**

"This leaves you in a challenging position. Behavioral therapy and lifestyle modifications are important, but patients often need additional support to implement them effectively. Nootropics and supplements have unknown long-term effects and variable quality.

Meanwhile, untreated focus issues affect academic performance, career success, relationship quality, and self-esteem. The gap between what patients need and what you can safely recommend is frustrating."

**(SOLVE)**

"That's why Focus is so valuable. It provides concentration support through Vibrotactile Technology – neural pathway activation rather than stimulant medication.

There's nothing going into the body – no dopamine flooding, no cardiovascular stress, no appetite effects. Patients wear the patch, and the specialized ridge patterns activate attention-related neural pathways through mechanoreceptor stimulation.

It's safe for all ages including children, has no contraindications, and can be used alone or alongside behavioral therapy."

**(EVIDENCE)**

"The science foundation is mechanoreceptor research that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine. VTT legitimately activates neural pathways – it's not placebo or wishful thinking.

For your patients, this means drug-free focus support without the tradeoffs of stimulant medication. For parents, it means an option they can feel good about. For your practice, it means filling the gap between 'do nothing' and 'Schedule II medication.'

Would you like to trial Focus with appropriate patients?"

***

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### 1. "Attention issues require proper medical treatment, not a patch."

**Response:** "I agree that significant attention disorders need comprehensive care. Focus isn't meant to replace that – it's meant to fill the gap for patients where medication isn't appropriate or isn't working.

It can support patients during behavioral therapy, serve as a first-line option for mild concerns, or supplement other interventions. Where do you see the gap in your current treatment options?"

### 2. "Parents will use this to avoid proper diagnosis and treatment."

**Response:** "That's a legitimate concern. The way to address it is positioning – Focus is a tool in your clinical toolkit, not an alternative to evaluation.

You can recommend Focus for appropriate patients while still encouraging comprehensive assessment. It actually might increase parent compliance with evaluation when they see you're offering options beyond medication. How do you typically approach parent hesitancy about assessment?"

### 3. "How does this compare to stimulant medication efficacy?"

**Response:** "Stimulant medications have robust efficacy data for ADHD. Focus works through a different mechanism and has different applications.

For severe ADHD, medication may still be appropriate. For mild-moderate concerns, patients who can't tolerate medications, or as adjunct support, Focus provides drug-free assistance. It's about expanding your options, not replacing proven treatments. Does that positioning make sense?"

### 4. "I'm skeptical about patches for cognitive function."

**Response:** "That skepticism is reasonable – the market has many questionable products. The key differentiator is mechanism.

VTT works through mechanoreceptor activation – the same pathways in Nobel Prize-winning research. It's not a transdermal drug delivery system or placebo. Would understanding the mechanism in more detail address the skepticism?"

### 5. "What about children with serious attention issues?"

**Response:** "For diagnosed ADHD with significant impairment, medication may be appropriate. Focus isn't meant to replace that assessment or treatment.

It's valuable for the many children with focus challenges who fall short of medication criteria, or whose parents want to try other approaches first, or who have side effects on medication. Would that population be relevant for your practice?"

### 6. "Nootropics and supplements already fill this space."

**Response:** "Nootropics have variable quality, unknown long-term effects, and uncertain mechanisms. Parents are often more uncomfortable with unregulated supplements than they are with a patch.

Focus works through a documented neural pathway mechanism with no systemic absorption. It's a cleaner, more defined option. How comfortable are you recommending nootropics to patients?"

### 7. "Insurance won't cover this."

**Response:** "You're right that Focus is an out-of-pocket expense. However, many families are willing to invest in drug-free options, especially for their children.

The cost of Focus over time is often less than medication copays plus the cost of managing side effects. How do your patients typically respond to out-of-pocket wellness recommendations?"

### 8. "I need to see more research specifically on Focus."

**Response:** "I understand wanting product-specific research. The underlying mechanism – VTT and mechanoreceptor activation – is based on Nobel Prize-winning science.

The best way to evaluate Focus is trialing it with appropriate patients in your practice. Would you like to start with a small pilot and assess results directly?"

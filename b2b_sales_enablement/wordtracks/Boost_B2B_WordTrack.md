## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION SCRIPT (2-Minute)

**(Problem-Agitate-Solve-Evidence Framework)**

**(PROBLEM)**

"Fatigue is epidemic – and it undermines everything. Patients can't exercise, can't focus on recovery, can't comply with your recommendations when they're exhausted. But the standard solutions – caffeine, energy drinks, stimulants – create their own problems: anxiety, sleep disruption, crashes, and dependency."

**(AGITATE)**

"For your patients who are stimulant-sensitive – those with anxiety, heart conditions, adrenal fatigue, or who are already on medications that interact with caffeine – the options are even more limited. They need energy to heal, but the typical solutions make other things worse.

And adaptogens or B-vitamins, while valuable, often take weeks to show effect. Patients need support now while you address root causes."

**(SOLVE)**

"That's where Boost comes in. Using Vibrotactile Technology based on Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research, Boost activates natural energy pathways through neural stimulation – not chemical stimulation.

There's nothing going into the body, no caffeine, no stimulants. Patients report sustained energy without jitters or crashes, and it doesn't interfere with sleep or medications. They simply apply the patch and go about their day."

**(EVIDENCE)**

"The science foundation is solid – the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded for discoveries about mechanoreceptors and how they translate physical stimuli into neural signals. That's exactly how VTT works.

For your practice, this means: a drug-free option for fatigued patients, better treatment compliance, and no contraindications to worry about. Would you like to trial this with appropriate patients?"

***

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### 1. "Energy issues are usually symptoms of other problems."

**Response:** "Absolutely – and that's what you're treating. But here's the reality: fatigued patients can't comply with exercise recommendations, can't engage fully in therapy, and often turn to harmful solutions.

Boost provides supportive energy while you address root causes. It's about enabling your treatment plan, not replacing it. How do you currently support patients' energy during the root cause investigation?"

### 2. "How can a patch provide energy without stimulants?"

**Response:** "VTT works through mechanoreceptor activation – the same pathways that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine. Rather than flooding the system with caffeine or other chemicals, it supports neural pathways that regulate energy and alertness naturally.

Think of it as optimizing the body's own energy systems rather than forcing stimulation. Would understanding the mechanism in more detail be helpful?"

### 3. "My patients need to fix their lifestyle, not use more products."

**Response:** "I agree lifestyle is foundational. And Boost can help bridge the gap while patients implement those changes.

Having energy to exercise, prepare healthy meals, and engage with life makes lifestyle change possible. It's a tool to enable the changes you're recommending. Does that framing resonate with your approach?"

### 4. "I'm concerned this is just a placebo effect."

**Response:** "That's a fair scientific question. The VTT mechanism is based on Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research – it's not simply placebo.

That said, I understand wanting to see results in your own patients. Would you like to trial Boost with a few appropriate patients and evaluate their response?"

### 5. "Patients expect immediate, dramatic energy from anything I recommend."

**Response:** "That's an expectation set by stimulants, and it's not sustainable. Boost provides sustained energy – patients don't feel 'wired,' they feel capable.

It's about normal, functional energy rather than artificial peaks and crashes. How do you typically set expectations for energy support with patients?"

### 6. "What about patients with chronic fatigue syndrome?"

**Response:** "CFS patients are actually a good fit because they often can't tolerate stimulants at all. Boost provides gentle energy support without the stress response that exacerbates CFS.

It won't cure CFS – nothing will quickly – but it can help patients function better while you work on underlying factors. Would that be valuable for your CFS patients?"

### 7. "How is this different from B-vitamins or adaptogen supplements?"

**Response:** "Those work through nutritional pathways and can take weeks to show effect. Boost works through neural pathway activation – it's a different mechanism entirely.

Patients can use Boost alongside supplements. It provides the immediate support while adaptogens and nutrients build long-term resilience. Does that complementary approach make sense?"

### 8. "I don't want patients to become dependent on another product."

**Response:** "That's exactly the concern with stimulants. Boost doesn't work through chemical dependency pathways – there's no tolerance buildup, no withdrawal, no need for increasing doses.

Patients can use it consistently or as needed without developing dependency. That's fundamentally different from caffeine or prescription stimulants."

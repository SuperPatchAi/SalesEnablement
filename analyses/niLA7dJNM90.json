KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS\n\n**Framework/Technique Name:** Assumptive Close\n\n**How to Apply the Assumptive Close (Based on Speaker's Examples):**\n1.  **Adopt a \"When, Not If\" Mindset:** Believe that if your product/service is the right fit and solves a problem for the prospect, they *will* eventually buy. This belief impacts your language and questions.\n2.  **Avoid Passive Language:** Do not ask for permission to sell or directly inquire \"Will you buy my product/service?\" This places all control on the prospect.\n3.  **Avoid Aggressive Language:** Do not demand a decision or say things like \"You need to make a decision on this right now.\" This scares prospects away.\n4.  **Frame Questions Around Next Steps & Logistics:** Instead of asking *if* they'll buy, ask *when* or *how* they'll proceed with the purchase, assuming the decision has already been made or will be made. Offer choices for logistics rather than the decision to buy itself.\n5.  **Use Assumptive Statements:** Present future actions as definite, even if the final commitment hasn't been made.\n\n**The Psychology/Principle Behind Why it Works:**\n*   **\"When, not if\":** This mindset reduces hesitancy in the salesperson and subtly steers the conversation towards the logical next steps post-purchase, rather than dwelling on the initial decision to buy.\n*   **Pre-supposes Agreement:** By asking questions that assume the sale (e.g., \"Which day for delivery?\" instead of \"Are you buying?\"), you naturally guide the prospect into thinking about the practicalities of ownership, making the purchase feel more like an inevitable outcome.\n*   **Maintains Control (Subtly):** It allows the salesperson to maintain control of the sales process by leading the conversation towards logical conclusions without being overtly pushy.\n*   **Impacts Language and Questions:** The belief in the eventual close will naturally lead to more confident and forward-looking communication, influencing how the prospect perceives the interaction.\n\n### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS\n\n**Examples of Too Passive (Avoid):**\n*   \"Hey Mr. Customer, hey Mrs. Customer, will you buy my product?\" (0:44)\n*   \"Hey Mr. Customer, would you like to buy my product or service?\" (1:05)\n*   \"Hey, can we meet next Tuesday?\" (2:18)\n\n**Examples of Too Aggressive (Avoid):**\n*   \"Hey Mr. Customer, you need to make a decision on this right now.\" (0:53)\n\n**Examples of Assumptive Close Questions & Statements (Use):**\n*   **Regarding Delivery/Logistics:** \"What day works better for delivery, Monday or Tuesday?\" (1:11)\n*   **Regarding Implementation Process:** \"When you sign the order, this is what the implementation process will look like.\" (1:43)\n*   **Regarding Quantity/Scope:** \"How many total licenses will you need?\" (1:50)\n*   **Regarding Technical Setup:** \"What day would you like our technical team to begin implementation with your IT manager?\" (1:56)\n*   **Regarding Next Meeting:** \"Let's meet next Tuesday to review the pricing.\" (2:04)\n*   **Dating Analogy (Personal Example):** \"Hey Amanda, when would you like to hang out again, Monday or Tuesday of next week?\" (3:10)\n\n### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING\nThe video **does not explicitly discuss objection handling**. The entire premise of the assumptive close is to frame the conversation in a way that *prevents* common objections by assuming a positive outcome (the purchase) and focusing on the \"when\" and \"how\" rather than the \"if.\" This proactive approach aims to guide the prospect past the point of direct \"no\" answers.\n\n### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS\n1.  **Adopt the \"When, Not If\" Mindset:** Approach every sales interaction with the belief that if there's a good fit and you can solve a problem, the prospect *will* buy.\n2.  **Avoid Extremes:** Don't be too passive (asking for permission to close) or too aggressive (demanding a decision immediately). Find the confident middle ground.\n3.  **Use Assumptive Language:** Frame your questions and statements around the logistics and next steps of the purchase, rather than whether the purchase will happen.\n4.  **Influence Through Language:** Your internal belief and the language you use directly impact the flow and outcome of your sales conversations, subtly guiding the prospect towards a purchase.\n5.  **Practice on Next Steps:** Instead of asking for a close, ask for the *next logical step* assuming the sale (e.g., delivery day, implementation schedule, next meeting to discuss details).\n\n### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION\n\nApplying the Assumptive Close to selling Super Patch wellness products in a direct sales/network marketing context:\n\n1.  **Initial Discovery/Problem-Solving:**\n    *   Instead of: \"Are you interested in pain relief with Super Patch?\"\n    *   Try: **\"When you experience the relief from the Super Patch, what activity are you most excited to get back to?\"** (Assumes they *will* experience relief and use the patch).\n    *   Instead of: \"Do you think these patches could help you sleep better?\"\n    *   Try: **\"When you start getting a full night's sleep with the Sleep Patch, how will that impact your energy levels during the day?\"** (Assumes improved sleep).\n\n2.  **Product Selection/Customization:**\n    *   Instead of: \"Which patch would you like to try?\"\n    *   Try: **\"Are we going to start you with the Pain Relief Patch for your knee, or the Energy Patch to tackle those afternoon slumps?\"** (Assumes they are ready to start with *a* patch).\n    *   Instead of: \"Would you prefer a single pack or a bundle?\"\n    *   Try: **\"Many people start with the Starter Bundle because it addresses multiple needs. Will that work best for you, or do we need to customize it further?\"** (Assumes the bundle is a good fit and they're moving forward).\n\n3.  **Ordering & Next Steps:**\n    *   Instead of: \"Are you ready to place an order?\"\n    *   Try: **\"When we get your order processed, will you prefer the 30-day or the 90-day supply of the patch?\"** (Assumes the order is happening, focuses on quantity).\n    *   Instead of: \"Do you want to sign up for auto-ship?\"\n    *   Try: **\"For maximum savings and convenience, we'll set you up with the auto-ship program. What day of the month works best for your recurring order?\"** (Assumes auto-ship, focuses on delivery date).\n    *   Instead of: \"Can I get your shipping information?\"\n    *   Try: **\"Let's confirm your shipping details so we can get your Super Patches on their way to you right away.\"** (Assumes they're providing info).\n\n4.  **Team Building/Business Opportunity (Network Marketing):**\n    *   Instead of: \"Are you interested in joining my team and selling Super Patch?\"\n    *   Try: **\"When you start sharing these patches and see the positive impact on others, what kind of income goal are we setting for your first 90 days?\"** (Assumes they will join and succeed).\n    *   Instead of: \"Would you like to learn more about the business?\"\n    *   Try: **\"Let's schedule a brief call next Tuesday or Wednesday to outline how you can build a successful Super Patch business around your current commitments.\"** (Assumes they'll learn more and implies flexibility).\n\nBy adopting the \"when, not if\" mindset and using these assumptive questions, Super Patch direct sales representatives can guide their prospects more confidently through the sales process, making the purchase or team enrollment feel like a natural and expected progression."

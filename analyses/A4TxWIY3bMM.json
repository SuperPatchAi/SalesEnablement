KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS\n\n**Framework/Technique 1: Create a Consistent Follow-up Cadence.**\n*   **Step-by-step process:**\n    1.  Build a process within your CRM system to ensure no prospects are lost.\n    2.  Use the CRM consistently and be disciplined in its application.\n    3.  Avoid fully automating follow-up; maintain a personal, \"genuine touch.\"\n    4.  Apply this cadence to both new prospects (moving them to customers) and existing customers (generating additional opportunities).\n*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:** A consistent cadence prevents losing potential business by ensuring prospects and customers are regularly engaged. The \"genuine touch\" builds credibility and authenticity, differentiating from purely automated marketing. It ensures opportunities are not \"lost halfway through\" the sales cycle or with existing clients.\n\n**Framework/Technique 2: Bring New Value to Every Follow-up.**\n*   **Step-by-step process:**\n    1.  For every follow-up, ask yourself: \"What's the new value I'm bringing to them?\"\n    2.  New value doesn't always have to be a product or service offering; it can be relevant information or insights.\n    3.  Actively share external resources (e.g., articles, books) that are valuable to the prospect's situation, even if not directly from your company.\n    4.  Be prepared to \"pivot\" if the initial solution isn't the right fit, using new value to guide the change.\n*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:** This approach keeps the conversation fresh and demonstrates that you are a helpful resource, not just a salesperson pushing a product. Sharing external value builds integrity and authenticity, fostering trust. It prevents overwhelming a confused customer who \"doesn't buy\" by focusing on relevant, timely insights.\n\n**Framework/Technique 3: Engage Multiple Contacts.**\n*   **Step-by-step process:**\n    1.  Identify all relevant stakeholders within a prospect's or customer's organization.\n    2.  Actively work to generate and maintain relationships with multiple contacts.\n    3.  Continuously look for opportunities to \"add on\" new contacts.\n*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:** \"The bigger the opportunity...the more contacts you need to have.\" This diversifies your relationship within an account, mitigating risk if a single point of contact leaves (preventing you from being \"lost, and I lost the account\"). It also increases opportunities to solve broader problems within the organization (\"Can you help us with this? Can you help us with this?\").\n\n**Framework/Technique 4: Keep It Simple.**\n*   **Step-by-step process:**\n    1.  Avoid overcomplicating your follow-up messages and interactions.\n    2.  Focus on very simple dialogue, interactions, and conveying new value.\n    3.  Streamline your process and communication.\n*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:** \"A confused customer doesn't buy.\" Simplicity allows the prospect or customer to maintain a \"clear sense of mind\" about how you can help them, leading to easier decision-making and engagement. It prevents \"screwing up\" by making things unnecessarily complex.\n\n**Framework/Technique 5: Know When to Cut Loose.**\n*   **Step-by-step process:**\n    1.  Evaluate each prospect in terms of its \"total opportunity\" and \"lifetime value.\"\n    2.  Use this assessment to determine how long you should continue to pursue the opportunity.\n    3.  If the potential value is \"small potatoes\" and you haven't received engagement after 5-7 touches, be prepared to \"walk away.\"\n    4.  For \"significant opportunities,\" commit to \"stay in the game\" and make it happen.\n*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:** This is a critical time management and strategic decision. It prevents wasting valuable time and resources on leads that are unlikely to convert or yield sufficient return. It focuses effort on prospects where \"the chase is going to be worth the reward.\"\n\n### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS\nThe speaker emphasizes principles over exact scripts, but here are the key phrases that give a sense of his suggested approach:\n\n*   **For demonstrating new value (e.g., sharing a book):** \"Hey, I read this book and it's incredibly valuable.\"\n*   **For engaging multiple contacts and uncovering new needs (implied questions customers/prospects might ask you if you maintain contact):** \"Oh, hey, can you help us with this? Can you help us with this? Can you provide this? Can you provide that?\"\n*   **Regarding sending personal books:** \"I love to send them books. You probably sitting there saying, 'Oh Mark, I bet you send them out your books.' No, not my books. I send out other people's books.\"\n\n### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING\nThe video does not explicitly address objections in a direct Q&A format. However, the techniques themselves serve as proactive ways to overcome common challenges in follow-up:\n\n*   **Implicit Objection: \"Why are you bothering me again?\" / \"You're just trying to sell me.\"**\n    *   **Reframe/Psychology:** Add new value (Technique 2) by providing insights or helpful information, not just a sales pitch. This shifts the interaction from purely transactional to valuable and collaborative.\n*   **Implicit Objection: \"I forgot about you/our last conversation.\"**\n    *   **Reframe/Psychology:** A consistent follow-up cadence (Technique 1) ensures you remain top-of-mind. Keep it simple (Technique 4) so that the core message is always clear and easy to recall.\n*   **Implicit Objection: \"My contact left, so our deal is dead.\"**\n    *   **Reframe/Psychology:** Engaging multiple contacts (Technique 3) within an organization prevents reliance on a single point of failure, maintaining multiple avenues for communication and business.\n\n### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n1.  **Systematic Consistency is Non-Negotiable:** Implement a disciplined, multi-channel follow-up cadence, utilizing your CRM system actively rather than passively, ensuring consistent, personal engagement.\n2.  **Value-Driven Interactions:** Each follow-up must deliver new value (insights, information, external resources) to the prospect or customer, preventing the interaction from feeling like a mere sales chase and building trust.\n3.  **Expand Your Network within Accounts:** For significant opportunities or existing customers, actively seek and cultivate relationships with multiple contacts to increase your selling opportunities and protect against single points of failure.\n4.  **Clarity Through Simplicity:** Keep all follow-up communications and processes straightforward and easy to understand to avoid confusing prospects and facilitate clear decision-making.\n5.  **Strategic Qualification for Engagement:** Continuously assess the total opportunity and lifetime value of each prospect to determine how long to invest in follow-up, knowing when to gracefully \"cut loose\" low-potential leads to optimize your sales efforts.\n\n### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION\n\nHere\u2019s how these follow-up techniques can be specifically applied to selling Super Patch wellness products in a direct sales/network marketing context:\n\n1.  **Create a Consistent Follow-up Cadence (Super Patch):**\n    *   **Application:** After a Super Patch demo, initial sample distribution, or enrollment conversation, have a structured plan.\n    *   **Exact Scripts/Examples:**\n        *   **Day 1 (after sample):** \"Hi [Prospect Name], just wanted to check in after you tried the [specific patch] last night. How did you feel when you woke up this morning?\" (Focus on immediate experience)\n        *   **Day 3 (after purchase/enrollment):** \"Hey [Customer Name], just reaching out to see if you've put on your first [specific patch]! Remember, consistency is key for best results. Let me know if any questions come up!\" (Encourage usage & offer support)\n        *   **Weekly (email/text):** Send short messages with testimonials from others using the same patch, or tips for maximizing patch benefits. \"Thought you'd find this interesting, [Customer Name]! Another user found great relief from [specific issue] by combining the Freedom and B12 patches. Just a thought!\"\n        *   **Monthly (calendar event):** Schedule calls or personalized emails around potential reorder times, or to introduce a complementary patch.\n\n2.  **Bring New Value to Every Follow-up (Super Patch):**\n    *   **Application:** Avoid constantly asking, \"Are you ready to buy/reorder?\" Instead, provide ongoing education and benefits.\n    *   **Exact Scripts/Examples:**\n        *   \"Hi [Prospect Name], I was just reading an article about the connection between [their specific pain point, e.g., inflammation] and overall wellness, and it reminded me of our discussion about how the [relevant patch] works with your body's natural systems. Here's the link if you're interested.\"\n        *   \"Thought of you, [Customer Name]! I just saw a video explaining the science behind how our patches interact with the nervous system to promote natural healing. It's a great visual if you want to understand more deeply.\"\n        *   \"Heard from a fellow team member today who experienced [specific, relatable result] with the [specific patch]. Just wanted to share that success story, hoping it inspires you!\"\n        *   \"Found this interesting tidbit about how proper sleep hygiene can enhance the effects of wellness products. Our Dream patch helps, but these tips can boost it further! [Link to blog post/article]\"\n\n3.  **Engage Multiple Contacts (Super Patch):**\n    *   **Application:** In direct sales, this is crucial for expanding your network and getting referrals. Think about families, friends, or community groups.\n    *   **Exact Scripts/Examples:**\n        *   \"You mentioned your spouse also experiences [similar issue, e.g., chronic back pain]. Would they be open to trying a sample of the Freedom patch? I'd be happy to send one their way too.\"\n        *   \"I know you're part of a running club; many athletes use our patches for recovery and performance. Would you be comfortable introducing me to anyone there who might be interested in a quick chat about [specific patch benefits for athletes]?\"\n        *   \"If you're finding great results, [Customer Name], perhaps your friends or family might benefit too! I'm always looking to share these amazing patches. Who comes to mind that might need better sleep or pain relief?\"\n        *   \"I'd love to share a short presentation about wellness solutions with your workplace. Many companies are looking for ways to boost employee energy and focus. Could you help me connect with the right person?\"\n\n4.  **Keep It Simple (Super Patch):**\n    *   **Application:** Avoid overwhelming new users or prospects with too much scientific jargon or too many product choices.\n    *   **Exact Scripts/Examples:**\n        *   **Initial explanation:** \"Super Patch uses a unique patterned technology that communicates with your brain to activate your body's natural healing abilities. Just stick it on and go!\"\n        *   **Email subject lines:** \"Quick Q about your patch,\" \"Energy Boost Tip,\" \"Sleep Better Tonight.\"\n        *   **Follow-up questions:** \"How did the patch feel today?\" \"Did you notice any difference?\" (Simple, direct, open-ended)\n        *   \"I know there are many patches, but let's focus on the [specific patch] for your [primary need] first. Once you experience that, we can explore other options.\"\n\n5.  **Know When to Cut Loose (Super Patch):**\n    *   **Application:** Identify leads who are truly unresponsive or consistently express disinterest after genuine attempts, to focus on more promising prospects.\n    *   **Exact Scripts/Examples:**\n        *   **After 3-5 unanswered attempts:** \"Hi [Prospect Name], I've tried reaching out a few times about Super Patch and haven't heard back. I'll assume now isn't the best time, but I wanted to offer one last chance to connect. If your wellness needs change, please don't hesitate to reach out.\"\n        *   **If they give a clear \"no\" or strong resistance:** \"I completely understand that Super Patch might not be the right fit for you at this moment, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm here if you ever reconsider, but I won't continue to reach out unless you prefer.\"\n        *   **If the interaction is consistently draining with little progress:** Evaluate if the potential customer's lifetime value (repeat purchases, potential referrals) justifies continued effort, or if your time is better spent on others."

## 1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW (Clinical Focus)

**Peace** provides drug-free stress management and calm support using Vibrotactile Technology (VTT). For patients seeking anxiety and stress relief without pharmaceuticals, Peace works through neural pathway modulation based on Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research (2021).

### Clinical Mechanism
Peace utilizes specialized VTT ridge patterns that:
- Activate mechanoreceptors influencing calming pathways
- Support parasympathetic nervous system activation
- Modulate stress response neural networks
- Promote calm and clarity without sedation

### Key Differentiators
| Feature | Anxiolytics/Sedatives | VTT (Peace) |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|
| Mechanism | GABA/CNS depression | Neural pathway modulation |
| Sedation | Common | None |
| Dependency | Risk | None |
| Cognitive Effects | Impairment | Clarity |
| Contraindications | Many | None |

### Practice Integration Benefits
- **Non-Pharmaceutical Option:** For patients avoiding anxiolytics
- **Clarity, Not Sedation:** Patients remain functional and alert
- **Complementary:** Works alongside stress management protocols
- **Safe Long-Term:** No tolerance or dependency development

## 3. OPENING SCRIPTS

### 1. Cold Call
"Good morning, this is [Your Name] from Super Patch. I'm reaching out because stress and anxiety are affecting patient outcomes across every specialty.

### 2. Email Introduction
**Subject:** Drug-Free Stress & Calm Support for Your Patients

"Dr. [Name],

Chronic stress undermines treatment outcomes across every condition. Yet many patients refuse anxiolytics due to side effects, sedation, or dependency concerns.

Our Peace patch uses Vibrotactile Technology – neural pathway modulation that promotes calm and clarity without sedation or cognitive impairment. Drug-free, no dependency, no contraindications.

Would you be open to discussing how this could support your stressed patients?

Best regards,

## 4. DISCOVERY QUESTIONS

1. "What percentage of your patients present with stress or anxiety affecting their health?"
2. "How does chronic stress impact your treatment outcomes?"
3. "What do you currently recommend for patients who want drug-free stress support?"
4. "Are patients asking for alternatives to prescription anxiety medications?"

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION (2-Minute)

**[PROBLEM]**
"Stress is the silent saboteur of treatment outcomes. It exacerbates pain, disrupts sleep, impairs immune function, and derails every protocol you implement. But pharmaceutical options for anxiety often come with sedation, cognitive impairment, and dependency risks. Many patients refuse them – leaving them without support while stress undermines their health."

**[SOLUTION]**
"Peace uses Vibrotactile Technology to support calm and clarity through neural pathway modulation – not CNS depression. Based on Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research, it promotes parasympathetic activation without sedation. Patients remain clear and functional while experiencing reduced stress.

For your practice: a drug-free option for stressed patients, better treatment outcomes, and 25% practitioner margin. Would you like to trial this with appropriate patients?"

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Anxiety needs proper diagnosis and treatment."
**Response:** "Absolutely – and Peace isn't diagnostic or a replacement for clinical treatment. It's supportive care for patients who experience everyday stress or who want drug-free complementary support. For patients with clinical anxiety, it can work alongside their treatment plan. What matters is giving patients options that fit their preferences and needs."

### "How can a patch reduce stress without sedation?"
**Response:** "VTT works through mechanoreceptor activation supporting parasympathetic pathways – the 'rest and digest' system. It's modulating neural tone, not depressing the CNS. Think of it as promoting the same calm state that meditation or deep breathing activates, but through continuous sensory input rather than conscious practice."

### "My patients need therapy and lifestyle changes, not products."
**Response:** "Therapy and lifestyle changes are foundational – and Peace supports those efforts. When patients feel calmer, they engage better with therapy, make better lifestyle choices, and follow through on your recommendations. It's an enabling tool, not a replacement for comprehensive care."

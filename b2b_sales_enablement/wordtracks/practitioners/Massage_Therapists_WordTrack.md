## 3. OPENING SCRIPTS FOR MASSAGE THERAPISTS

### Script 1: Touch Expert Opening
"Hi [Name], I'm [Your Name] with SuperPatch. I'm reaching out because massage therapists understand something powerful – the impact of touch on the whole body. Our Vibrotactile Technology works through that same principle. Specialized patterns stimulate touch receptors in the skin, activating neural pathways for pain relief, better sleep, or stress reduction. It's like your work continues even after the client goes home. Sound interesting?"

### Script 2: Client Support Opening
"Hi [Name], I'm [Your Name] from SuperPatch. Do your clients ever ask what they can do at home to maintain the benefits of their massage? I work with massage therapists who want to give clients drug-free options for between-session support. Our patches extend your work without any chemicals or medications. Would that be helpful for your practice?"

### Script 3: Retail Opportunity Opening
"Hi [Name], I'm [Your Name] with SuperPatch. Many massage therapists I work with have been looking for professional-grade products to offer clients. Our drug-free VTT patches are a perfect add-on recommendation after sessions – especially for pain, stress, and sleep. Are you currently retailing any products, or is that something you'd consider?"

### Script 4: Event/Expo Approach
"Hi! Are you a massage therapist? Great! I'm [Your Name] with SuperPatch. You know how important touch is for healing – our patches use that same principle. They stimulate touch receptors to activate the nervous system for pain relief and relaxation. Many LMTs recommend them to clients for home use between sessions. Have you heard of Vibrotactile Technology?"

### Script 5: Email/Social Outreach
"Hi [Name], as a massage therapist, you already know the power of touch for healing.

SuperPatch uses Vibrotactile Technology – specialized patterns that stimulate touch receptors continuously, supporting pain relief, sleep, or stress reduction even when clients aren't on your table.

Many LMTs recommend our Freedom patch for pain clients and REM patch for those with sleep issues. Would you be interested in learning how this could complement your practice?"

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION (Massage Therapist Language)

### Opening: Touch Connection
"[Name], as a massage therapist, you're an expert in how touch affects the body. You understand that working with the skin and tissue creates changes throughout the system – relaxing muscles, reducing pain, calming the nervous system. I want to share a technology that continues that work when clients leave your table."

### Problem
"Here's what I hear from massage therapists all the time: You do incredible work during the session. Clients leave feeling amazing. But within days – sometimes hours – they're back to square one. The stress builds back up, the tension returns, the pain creeps back in. And you can only see them so often."

### Agitate
"This is frustrating for everyone. Clients feel like they're on a hamster wheel – constant massage sessions just to stay at baseline. They might start questioning whether the investment is worth it. Meanwhile, you know the work is effective, but you can't follow them home. What happens outside your treatment room matters, and right now, you don't have much influence over that."

### Solve
"SuperPatch changes that. Our Vibrotactile Technology uses specialized ridge patterns that stimulate the same touch receptors you work with – mechanoreceptors in the skin. This stimulation activates neural pathways for pain relief, stress reduction, or sleep support.

Think of it as continuous, gentle touch therapy. It's not massage, but it extends the principle of touch-based healing to the other 23 hours a day when clients aren't on your table.

And because it's completely drug-free – no menthol, no lidocaine, no chemicals – it aligns with a holistic approach to care."

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING FOR MASSAGE THERAPISTS

### Objection 1: "I'm not a salesperson."
**Response:** "I totally get that – you became a massage therapist to help people, not to sell products. But think of it this way: when clients ask what they can do at home, you're providing a solution, not selling. It's part of comprehensive care. You probably already recommend stretches or self-massage techniques, right? This is just another tool in that toolkit."

### Objection 2: "My clients won't want to spend more money."
**Response:** "That's a fair concern. Here's what I've found: clients who value massage already understand investing in their wellness. At about $3 per day, it's less than their daily latte. And if it helps them maintain benefits longer, they might actually need fewer sessions – which could save them money. Which clients come to mind who really struggle between appointments?"

### Objection 3: "I've tried retail and it didn't work."
**Response:** "What happened? [Listen] I hear that a lot – usually it's because the products weren't a natural fit for the service, or they were hard to explain. Patches are different. You literally just say 'Wear this for pain relief between sessions' and hand it to them. There's nothing to explain about application or dosing. Would a simpler product make retail more appealing?"

### Objection 4: "How is this different from menthol patches?"
**Response:** "Great question! Menthol patches work by delivering a substance through the skin that creates a cooling sensation. SuperPatch doesn't deliver anything – it's purely the physical pattern stimulating touch receptors. No smell, no chemicals, no mess. For clients sensitive to menthol or who want something truly drug-free, this is a completely different category."

### Objection 5: "I'd want to try it first."
**Response:** "Absolutely – you should experience it before recommending it. Which do you deal with yourself – pain, stress, sleep issues, low energy? Let me send you a sample of the patch that fits your needs. Once you feel it work, the recommendation to clients becomes natural."

### Objection 6: "I don't have space to stock products."
**Response:** "I hear you – space is always tight. Here's the thing: the patches are small and don't expire quickly. You could literally keep them in a drawer and just pull one out when relevant. Or we can set you up with an affiliate link – you recommend, they order online, and you earn commission without stocking anything. Which would work better for you?"

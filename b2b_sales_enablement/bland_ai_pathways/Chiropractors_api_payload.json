The Freedom patch has completed a peer-reviewed, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT published in Pain Therapeutics. It's registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT06505005. I'd be happy to send you the full study abstract. Beyond that, we have the HARMONI sleep study and the Balance study for our other patches. What specific outcomes would be most relevant for your patient population?\"\n\n**If they say: \"My patients won't believe in a patch.\"**\nRespond: \"That's a fair concern. What we've found is that patients don't need to 'believe' \u2013 they just need to experience it. Many DCs start by trying it themselves, then on a few patients who are open-minded. Once patients feel the difference, the conversations get much easier. Would you like to try a sample yourself first?\"\n\n**If they say: \"I already recommend supplements/products.\"**\nRespond: \"That's great \u2013 it shows your patients trust your recommendations. SuperPatch isn't competing with supplements; it's a completely different category. Supplements work internally; VTT works through neural pathways externally. Many practitioners use both. Which patients do you think could benefit from an additional drug-free option for pain relief?\"\n\n**If they say: \"It's too expensive for my patients.\"**\nRespond: \"I understand \u2013 value is important. At around $3 per day, many patients find it comparable to or less than their daily supplements. And unlike repeat purchases of pain relievers, the relief is consistent without building tolerance. For patients who would otherwise reach for NSAIDs daily, what's the value of avoiding those GI and cardiovascular risks?\"\n\n**If they say: \"I don't want to seem like I'm 'selling' products.\"**\nRespond: \"I hear that from a lot of practitioners. But here's another way to look at it: you're not selling \u2013 you're solving a problem patients are already asking about. When patients ask what they can do at home between visits, what do you currently tell them? This gives you an answer that aligns with your drug-free philosophy.\"\n\n**If they say: \"I'd need to see it work on my own patients first.\"**\nRespond: \"Absolutely \u2013 that's the best way to evaluate it. Would you like to start with a small practitioner kit to try with a few patients? We can set you up with samples and track their outcomes together. What conditions would you want to test it with first?\"\n\n**If they say: \"I don't have time to learn a new product.\"**\nRespond: \"I get it – your schedule is packed. The good news is there's almost no learning curve. It's a simple patch application, and we provide patient education materials. Most DCs just say, 'This is what I recommend for support at home between visits.' Would a quick 10-minute training call help you feel confident introducing it?\"\n\n**If they say: \"How is this different from other patches like Salonpas?\"**\nRespond: \"Great question. Traditional patches like Salonpas work through transdermal drug delivery – they put menthol or lidocaine into your body. SuperPatch uses Vibrotactile Technology – it doesn't deliver any substance. The specialized ridge patterns stimulate mechanoreceptors in your skin, which then activate neural pathways. It's a completely different mechanism that aligns with your drug-free approach.\"\n\n**GENERAL APPROACH:**\n1. Acknowledge their concern (\"I understand...\")\n2. Provide relevant information or evidence\n3. Ask a question to re-engage them\n\nAfter handling the objection:\n- If resolved positively \u2192 route back to \"Product Presentation\" or \"Business Model Discussion\"\n- If they have more concerns \u2192 stay in objection handling\n- If they want to end the call \u2192 route to \"Polite Exit\"\n",

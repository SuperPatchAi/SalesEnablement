## 3. OPENING SCRIPTS FOR FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE

### Script 1: Systems Approach Opening
"Dr. [Name], I'm [Your Name] with SuperPatch. I'm reaching out to functional medicine practitioners because you understand systems biology – how one intervention can affect multiple pathways. Our Vibrotactile Technology works through mechanoreceptor activation to modulate neural signaling. It's a non-pharmaceutical approach that doesn't compete with your root-cause work. Would you be interested in learning how other FM practitioners are integrating this?"

### Script 2: Root Cause Support Opening
"Hi Dr. [Name], I know functional medicine focuses on root causes, and rightly so. But while that foundational work is happening, patients often struggle with symptoms – pain, sleep issues, stress. SuperPatch offers drug-free symptomatic support that works through neural pathways, not chemistry. It bridges the gap without adding metabolic load. Does that fit a gap in your patient care?"

### Script 3: Evidence-Based Opening
"Dr. [Name], as a functional medicine practitioner, you demand evidence. I wanted to share that our Freedom patch just completed a peer-reviewed, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT showing significant pain reduction and improved ROM. It's registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. Would clinical-level evidence make this worth exploring?"

### Script 4: Protocol Integration Opening
"Hi Dr. [Name], I work with several functional medicine practices who have integrated SuperPatch into their patient protocols. They use it as symptomatic support while addressing root causes – for example, Freedom for pain while working up inflammation, or REM for sleep while optimizing circadian biology. Would you be interested in seeing how this fits into comprehensive protocols?"

### Script 5: Email Outreach
"Dr. [Name], functional medicine's strength is addressing root causes. But patients need support during the journey.

SuperPatch offers drug-free, non-oral symptomatic support through Vibrotactile Technology – mechanoreceptor stimulation that modulates neural pathways. No metabolic load, no interactions, no compliance burden.

Our Freedom patch completed a peer-reviewed RCT (NCT06505005). Our REM patch showed 80% of participants stopped sleep medications.

Would you be open to discussing how this could support your protocols?"

## 4. DISCOVERY QUESTIONS FOR FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE

### Practice & Philosophy
1. "How do you typically structure your approach – what's your framework for root-cause investigation?"
2. "What percentage of your patients present with multiple overlapping conditions?"
3. "How long do patients typically work with you before seeing meaningful improvement?"

### Patient Challenges
4. "What's the biggest challenge for patients during the foundational phase of treatment?"
5. "How do you currently provide symptomatic support while root-cause work is underway?"
6. "Do you have patients who are sensitive to oral supplements or have absorption issues?"
7. "What do you tell patients who are frustrated waiting for results?"

### Protocol & Integration
8. "How many supplements or interventions are your patients typically on?"
9. "How do you think about adding versus simplifying patient protocols?"
10. "What non-oral modalities do you currently incorporate – IV therapy, injections, wearables?"

### Decision Factors
11. "When evaluating a new modality, what's most important – mechanism, evidence, patient tolerance, or cost?"
12. "How do you feel about technologies that address symptoms versus root causes?"
13. "Would you prefer to dispense directly or refer patients to purchase?"

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION (Systems Biology Language)

### Opening: Root Cause Acknowledgment
"Dr. [Name], I know functional medicine is about finding and fixing root causes – not just suppressing symptoms. I'm not here to suggest abandoning that approach. What I want to share is a tool for symptomatic support that doesn't compromise your foundational work."

### Problem
"Here's the reality: root-cause treatment takes time. You're running labs, optimizing the gut, addressing hormones, supporting detox – and that work is essential. But meanwhile, patients are suffering. They have pain that won't wait for their GI protocol to work. They have sleep issues that compound their fatigue. And they're asking for relief."

### Agitate
"So what are the options? Pharmaceuticals – which often create new problems and don't align with your philosophy. More supplements – adding to an already complex protocol and straining compliance. Or telling patients to just wait. None of these are ideal."

### Solve
"SuperPatch offers a different approach. Vibrotactile Technology works through mechanoreceptor activation – the same touch pathways recognized by the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine. The specialized ridge patterns stimulate neural signaling for pain relief, sleep support, or stress response modulation.

Here's why this fits functional medicine:
- **Non-pharmaceutical:** No drugs, no chemical intervention
- **No metabolic load:** Nothing to absorb, metabolize, or detoxify
- **No interactions:** Can't compete with your other interventions
- **No compliance burden:** It's one simple patch

It provides symptomatic support while your root-cause work takes effect."

### Explain: Protocol Integration Examples

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING FOR FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE

### Objection 1: "I focus on root causes, not symptom suppression."
**Response:** "I completely respect that – it's the foundation of FM. But consider this: symptomatic support doesn't have to mean suppression. VTT works with neural pathways, not against them. It's supporting the nervous system's own regulation while you address root causes. And unlike drugs, when the root cause is resolved, you can discontinue without rebound or dependency. How do you currently support patients symptomatically during treatment?"

### Objection 2: "My patients are already on too many things."
**Response:** "That's exactly why this might help. Unlike another supplement to take, process, and interact with everything else, this is a simple patch that works through skin receptors. No pills to time, no absorption to optimize, no interactions to worry about. For patients with protocol fatigue, this is one intervention that doesn't add complexity. What would simplification mean for patient compliance?"

### Objection 3: "I need to understand the mechanism better."
**Response:** "Of course – that's the FM approach. The mechanism is mechanoreceptor activation, primarily through Meissner's corpuscles and Merkel cells. This stimulates Piezo1/Piezo2 ion channels, which modulate neural signaling through established pathways like Gate Control Theory. There's no chemical transduction – it's purely physical signal modulation. Would you like our technical mechanism paper?"

### Objection 4: "How does this fit with my evidence-based approach?"
**Response:** "The Freedom patch completed a peer-reviewed, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT published in Pain Therapeutics, registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT06505005. The REM patch has the HARMONI study. The Liberty patch has a balance study with p<0.05 significance. This is clinical-grade evidence, not just anecdote. Which study would be most relevant for your practice?"

### Objection 5: "This seems like symptom Band-Aiding."
**Response:** "I understand that concern. Here's how to think about it: when a patient breaks their leg, you set the bone AND manage pain. The pain management doesn't prevent healing – it supports it. Similarly, VTT provides symptomatic support while your root-cause work addresses the underlying dysfunction. And because it's non-pharmaceutical, it doesn't create new problems to solve. Does that framing resonate?"

### Objection 6: "My patients can't afford more expenses."
**Response:** "That's valid – FM patients often invest significantly in their care. At $3 per day, this is less than most supplements. And for some patients, effective symptomatic support could reduce reliance on more expensive interventions. Which patients are struggling most with symptoms while waiting for foundational work to take effect?"

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION SCRIPT (2-Minute)

**(Problem-Agitate-Solve-Evidence Framework)**

**(PROBLEM)**

"Balance and fall prevention is one of the most critical challenges in healthcare. Falls are the leading cause of injury death in adults 65+, and balance issues limit progress in rehabilitation across virtually every condition.

The fundamental challenge is that balance gains made in clinic often don't translate to sustained improvement at home. Home exercise compliance is inconsistent, and patients need continuous support their environment isn't providing."

**(AGITATE)**

"This isn't just about falls – though those are devastating. Poor balance limits functional independence, reduces quality of life, and undermines every other intervention you're providing. An orthopedic patient can have a perfect surgery, but if their balance is compromised, their outcomes suffer.

And the current tools have limitations. Active exercises require compliance. Assistive devices don't improve balance – they compensate for it. Supplements address deficiencies but don't directly enhance proprioception."

**(SOLVE)**

"That's why Liberty is such a valuable tool. It's a drug-free, passive balance support solution using Vibrotactile Technology. Patients wear the patch, and the specialized ridge patterns continuously enhance proprioceptive pathways and neuromuscular coordination.

It's not replacing what you do – it's extending it. Patients get your expert care in sessions, and Liberty provides continuous support at home. No exercises to remember, no medication interactions, no risk."

**(EVIDENCE)**

"And here's what sets Liberty apart: clinical evidence. A controlled study published in the International Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation showed:
- 31% improvement in balance scores
- Statistically significant at p<0.05
- Measured using validated Sway Medical Balance Assessment

For fall prevention and rehabilitation, that's clinically meaningful improvement. For your patients, it could be the difference between maintaining independence and a devastating fall.

Would you like to see the full study and discuss how this might fit into your protocols?"

***

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### 1. "Balance improvement requires active training, not a patch."

**Response:** "I completely agree that active training is essential – Liberty doesn't replace that. Think of it as continuous passive support that enhances the active work you're doing.

The study showed 31% improvement in balance scores using VTT. It works by enhancing proprioceptive pathways – supporting the neuromuscular coordination your exercises are training. Would it be valuable as an adjunct to your active protocols?"

### 2. "31% sounds impressive, but what does that mean clinically?"

**Response:** "Great question – clinical relevance matters more than statistics. For balance, a 31% improvement in sway scores means measurably better stability and reduced fall risk.

In practical terms, that could mean the difference between a patient being able to turn safely in the bathroom or having a fall. For your patients, would improved stability scores be a meaningful outcome to track?"

### 3. "My patients are already on so many things – I don't want to add more."

**Response:** "I understand that concern completely – adding complexity isn't helpful. The beauty of Liberty is its simplicity.

There are no pills to remember, no exercises to do incorrectly, no drug interactions. Patients put on a patch and go about their day. It actually simplifies balance support rather than complicating it. Would that ease of use be valuable for your medically complex patients?"

### 4. "How is this different from compression garments or balance-enhancing footwear?"

**Response:** "Good question – those products work through mechanical support or proprioceptive feedback from compression. Liberty works differently – through Vibrotactile Technology that activates neural pathways.

We're not just providing mechanical stability; we're enhancing the neuromuscular coordination pathways themselves. The 31% improvement in the study reflects that neural enhancement. Would understanding the mechanism difference be helpful?"

### 5. "Insurance doesn't cover this, so patients won't pay out of pocket."

**Response:** "That's a valid concern. We find that patients who are concerned about falls – or their families – are often willing to invest in prevention.

The cost of a fall – medical bills, loss of independence, family caregiving burden – far exceeds the investment in prevention. How do your patients typically respond to out-of-pocket recommendations for fall prevention?"

### 6. "I need to see it work with my own patients before recommending broadly."

**Response:** "That's a completely reasonable approach. Would you like to start with a pilot program – try Liberty with 5-10 appropriate patients over 30 days and measure their balance progress?

That way you can evaluate results in your patient population before making any broader recommendations. Would that work for you?"

### 7. "My elderly patients are skeptical of new technology."

**Response:** "I understand – and simplicity helps with that. Liberty doesn't feel like 'technology' to patients. It's a patch they apply like a bandage.

For elderly patients, positioning it as 'helps with balance, drug-free, your doctor recommends it' is usually sufficient. What's been your experience introducing new recommendations to skeptical patients?"

### 8. "What's the evidence for long-term use?"

**Response:** "The current study was a controlled comparison showing immediate enhancement. For long-term use, VTT works with the body's natural systems, not against them – there's no tolerance or dependency concern.

Many patients use Liberty continuously as ongoing balance support. Would ongoing use for fall prevention be the application you're considering?"

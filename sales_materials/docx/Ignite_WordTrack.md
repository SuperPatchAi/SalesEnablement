1.  **"It's too expensive."**
    *   **Script:** "I understand that price is an important factor when you're considering new wellness solutions, and it's natural to want to ensure you're making a wise investment. What other criteria are most important for you in a product like this, beyond just the initial cost?"

5.  **"I've tried patches/products before."**
    *   **Script:** "I understand you've tried other things in the past, and it can be frustrating when they don't deliver on their promises. What was your experience with those, and what makes you hesitant about trying something new like Ignite?"

6.  **"I'm not interested."**
    *   **Script:** "I understand you might not be actively looking for new solutions right now, and that's perfectly fine. Is there anything specific that makes you feel it's not a fit, or have you just not heard enough about how Ignite works?"

7.  **"I don't have time."**
    *   **Script:** "I completely understand you have a very busy schedule – many of my clients do! If Ignite could help you feel more energetic and efficient, allowing you to get more out of your day, how much of a priority would finding a few moments to discuss it be for you?"

8.  **"How is this different from [competitor]?"**
    *   **Script:** "That's a great question, and I understand you're curious about how Ignite stands out. What have you heard or experienced about [competitor] that you're comparing it to, and what specifically are you looking for in a solution?"

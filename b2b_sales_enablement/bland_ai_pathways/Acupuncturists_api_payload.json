It's a complementary technology that works through a different mechanism \u2013 mechanoreceptor stimulation versus needle insertion. Many acupuncturists see it as a take-home bridge between sessions, not a replacement for treatment. How do your patients currently maintain benefits between appointments?\"\n\n**If they say: \"My patients come to me for natural therapy, not patches.\"**\nRespond: \"That makes sense \u2013 and this is about as natural as it gets. There are no chemicals, no drugs, nothing entering the body. It's purely a physical pattern that stimulates nerve receptors. Think of it like a continuous, gentle pressure rather than a substance. Would your patients appreciate having a drug-free option for home support?\"\n\n**If they say: \"I don't want to seem like I'm selling products.\"**\nRespond: \"I understand that concern. Many acupuncturists position this as patient support, not a sales pitch. When patients ask what they can do at home between sessions, this gives you an answer that aligns with your drug-free approach. It's about comprehensive patient care, not retail. Would framing it as 'homework' for patients feel more comfortable?\"\n\n**If they say: \"How does this work in TCM terms?\"**\nRespond: \"That's a great question. While VTT is a Western technology, many practitioners frame it in TCM language for patients. Freedom supports Qi flow for pain; REM calms the Shen for sleep; Peace soothes Liver Qi for stress. The mechanism is neural pathway activation, but the effects map well to TCM patterns. Would that framing resonate with your patients?\"\n\n**If they say: \"My patients can't afford acupuncture and products.\"**\nRespond: \"That's a valid concern. At about $3 per day, many patients find it's less than their daily coffee. And for some patients, having effective home support could mean they need fewer sessions \u2013 which might actually save them money overall. Which patients would benefit most from maintaining treatment progress at home?\"\n\n**If they say: \"I'd need to try it myself first.\"**\nRespond: \"Absolutely \u2013 I'd want the same thing. Would you like to start with a personal sample of Freedom or whichever patch aligns with something you're experiencing? That way you can feel it before recommending it.\"\n\n**GENERAL APPROACH:**\n1. Acknowledge their concern (\"I understand...\")\n2. Provide relevant information or evidence\n3. Ask a question to re-engage them\n\nAfter handling the objection:\n- If resolved positively \u2192 route back to \"Product Presentation\" or \"Business Model Discussion\"\n- If they have more concerns \u2192 stay in objection handling\n- If they want to end the call \u2192 route to \"Polite Exit\"\n",

Patients feel great after treatment, then within days they're back to square one.

        "text": "Handle objections professionally and return to the conversation flow.\n\nCOMMON OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES:\n\n**If they say: \"I've never heard of this \u2013 is it credible?\"**\nRespond: \"That's fair \u2013 it's relatively new to most physicians. What makes it credible is the evidence base. The Freedom patch has a peer-reviewed RCT published in Pain Therapeutics. The technology is based on mechanoreceptor science \u2013 the same field that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine. I'd be happy to send you the clinical study. What level of evidence would you need to feel comfortable recommending it?\"\n\n**If they say: \"How does this fit alongside my conventional treatments?\"**\nRespond: \"It fits as either first-line or adjunct. Because it's non-pharmaceutical with no interactions, you can layer it with conventional treatments or try it first. For pain, you might position it as 'Let's try this before escalating to medications.' For sleep, it could be part of a reduction strategy. How do you currently sequence conventional and complementary approaches?\"\n\n**If they say: \"My patients are already skeptical of patches.\"**\nRespond: \"That's understandable if they've tried transdermal drug patches without results. This is fundamentally different \u2013 it's not delivering a substance. The mechanism is physical pattern stimulation, not chemical delivery. For skeptical patients, framing it as 'Nobel Prize-recognized technology' or sharing the clinical trial data often helps. Would peer-reviewed evidence help your patients accept it?\"\n\n**If they say: \"I need more than one study.\"**\nRespond: \"I appreciate that rigorous thinking. We have three published studies \u2013 RESTORE for pain, HARMONI for sleep, and a Balance study. Plus ongoing research. That said, sometimes the best evidence is seeing it work for your own patients. Would you be interested in a small trial with selected patients while more data accumulates?\"\n\n**If they say: \"It seems too simple to work.\"**\nRespond: \"I understand \u2013 but sometimes the most elegant solutions are simple in application. The mechanism is actually sophisticated: specific ridge patterns calibrated to stimulate mechanoreceptors at precise frequencies, modulating neural signaling through established pathways. The Nobel Prize work showed how these touch pathways affect the entire nervous system. Would you like to see the mechanism documentation?\"\n\n**If they say: \"What's the cost to patients?\"**\nRespond: \"About $3 per day. For many patients, that's less than a daily medication co-pay, and often less than supplements they're already taking. For patients who value drug-free options, this is a reasonable investment. How do your patients typically prioritize cost versus alignment with their values?\"\n\n**GENERAL APPROACH:**\n1. Acknowledge their concern (\"I understand...\")\n2. Provide relevant information or evidence\n3. Ask a question to re-engage them\n\nAfter handling the objection:\n- If resolved positively \u2192 route back to \"Product Presentation\" or \"Business Model Discussion\"\n- If they have more concerns \u2192 stay in objection handling\n- If they want to end the call \u2192 route to \"Polite Exit\"\n",

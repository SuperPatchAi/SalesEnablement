No drugs absorbed at all.\"\n\n\"A lot of integrative practitioners have been using them for patients who need support between visits - especially for things like pain, sleep, and stress.\"\n\n## After Explaining:\n\nIF THEY SEEM INTERESTED:\n\u2192 Route to \"Discovery: Practice Overview\"\nSay: \"So tell me - what types of patients do you mostly see in your practice?\"\n\nIF THEY'RE STILL SKEPTICAL:\n\u2192 Route to \"Objection: Need Research\"\nListen for their concern and address it.\n\nIF THEY SAY \"NOT FOR ME\":\n\u2192 Route to \"Objection: Not Interested\"\nSay: \"Totally get it.

Here's what's cool about it:\n\nThe clinical evidence - we did a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 118 participants with chronic pain over 14 days. Published in Pain Therapeutics journal. Significant reduction in pain AND improvement in range of motion. It's registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT06505005 if you want to look it up.\n\nHow it works - the patch has these raised geometric patterns that stimulate mechanoreceptors in the skin. These are the same receptors that Nobel Prize-winning research identified. It signals through neural pathways to modulate pain perception. No drugs, nothing absorbed.\n\nFor your patients - they apply it in the morning, it lasts all day. No pills to remember, no side effects to worry about. Works out to about three dollars a day.\n\nFor your integrative practitioners patients specifically, it's great between adjustments when they might otherwise reach for NSAIDs.\"\n\n## After Presenting:\n\nIF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS:\n\u2192 Route to relevant objection node based on question\n\nIF THEY SEEM INTERESTED:\n\u2192 Route to \"Business Model Options\"\nSay: \"Want me to tell you how integrative practitioners typically work with us?\"\n\nIF THEY'RE SKEPTICAL:\n\u2192 Route to \"Objection: Need Research\"\n\n## What NOT to Do\n- Don't oversell or make medical claims\n- Don't rush through the clinical data\n- Pause for their reactions"

Present the REM patch.\n\n## Your Presentation\n\n\"For sleep, the REM patch is pretty remarkable. Let me share the study results:\n\nWe had participants who were averaging over an hour to fall asleep. By the end of the study, that dropped to about 37 minutes. But here's the big one - 80% of participants who were using sleep medications were able to stop using them.\n\nAnd unlike sleep meds, there's no morning grogginess. Patients wake up feeling rested, not foggy. No tolerance buildup either - day 30 works as well as day 1.\n\nHow they use it - they apply it about an hour before bed. The VTT technology signals the nervous system to shift into rest mode. Same mechanism as Freedom, just different neural pathways.\n\nFor your patients who've tried melatonin, tried sleep apps, tried everything - this is something different. It works through touch, not chemistry.\"\n\n## After Presenting:\n\nIF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS:\n\u2192 Route to relevant objection node\n\nIF INTERESTED IN MORE PRODUCTS:\n\u2192 Route to \"Present: Product Overview\" \n\nIF READY TO MOVE FORWARD:\n\u2192 Route to \"Business Model Options\"\n\n## What NOT to Do\n- Don't promise it replaces medical treatment\n- Don't claim it cures insomnia\n- Present it as a drug-free support option"

That's huge for patients dealing with stability issues - whether it's age-related, post-injury, or neurological.\n\nHow it works - the patch is worn on the upper back, near C7. The VTT pattern sends signals that help with proprioception - the body's sense of where it is in space.\n\nFor your senior patients especially, this can be life-changing.

This is good - it means they're thinking critically.\n\n## Your Response\n\n\"Honestly? I love that you're asking. As a healthcare provider, you should demand evidence. So here's what we have:\n\nThe Freedom patch went through a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial. 118 participants with chronic pain over 14 days. Published in Pain Therapeutics, peer-reviewed journal. Registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT06505005.\n\nWe also have the HARMONI study on sleep and the Balance study for Liberty. All peer-reviewed, all available for you to look at.\n\nThe lead researcher is from University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Legit academic work, not in-house marketing studies.\n\nI can email you the abstracts right after this call. What's your email?\"\n\n## If They're Still Skeptical:\n\n\"Look, I totally get it - I was skeptical too before I saw the data. But here's the thing - it's easy to verify. Look up the ClinicalTrials.gov registration. Read the published papers. The evidence is there.\"\n\n\n## Integrative Medicine Physicians-Specific Response\nFair question. The Freedom patch has a peer-reviewed RCT published in Pain Therapeutics. The technology is based on mechanoreceptor science - the same field that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine. I can send you the clinical study.\n\n\n## Integrative Medicine Physicians-Specific Response\nUnderstandable if they've tried transdermal drug patches. This is fundamentally different - not delivering a substance. The mechanism is physical pattern stimulation, not chemical delivery. Framing it as \"Nobel Prize-recognized technology\" often helps.\n\n## After Addressing:\n\nIF SATISFIED:\n\u2192 Route back to previous topic (presentation or business model)\nSay: \"So with that in mind, want to hear how integrative practitioners typically work with us?\"\n\nIF STILL SKEPTICAL:\n\u2192 Route to \"Offer Sample\"\nSay: \"You know what? The easiest thing is just to try it yourself. Can I send you a sample?\"\n\n## What NOT to Do\n- Don't get defensive\n- Don't dismiss their skepticism\n- Embrace their critical thinking"

Supplements work internally through chemistry. VTT works externally through neural pathways. Totally different mechanism.\n\nA lot of integrative practitioners use both. Like, they'll recommend turmeric for inflammation AND Freedom for pain signaling. Different approaches, same goal.\n\nThink of it as another tool in your toolkit.

But here's the thing - patients don't need to believe in it. They just need to experience it.\n\nThink about it this way: when you first explain [chiropractic/massage/acupuncture] to a new patient, do they fully understand how it works? Probably not. But they feel better afterward, so they keep coming back.\n\nSame thing here. The mechanism is sophisticated - neural signaling through mechanoreceptors - but the patient experience is simple. They put on a patch, they feel better. That's what matters to them.\n\nMost practitioners start by trying it themselves. Once you feel it, you understand. Then you try it on a few open-minded patients. Once they feel it, they become your evangelists.\"\n\n## If Still Skeptical:\n\n\"Look, you don't have to lead with the technology explanation. Just say 'try this patch, a lot of my patients have had good results.' Let the experience speak for itself.\"\n\n\n## Integrative Medicine Physicians-Specific Response\nFair question. The Freedom patch has a peer-reviewed RCT published in Pain Therapeutics. The technology is based on mechanoreceptor science - the same field that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine. I can send you the clinical study.\n\n\n## Integrative Medicine Physicians-Specific Response\nUnderstandable if they've tried transdermal drug patches. This is fundamentally different - not delivering a substance. The mechanism is physical pattern stimulation, not chemical delivery. Framing it as \"Nobel Prize-recognized technology\" often helps.\n\n## After Addressing:\n\nIF THEY'RE OPEN TO TRYING:\n\u2192 Route to \"Offer Sample\"\nSay: \"Would you be open to trying one yourself first?\"\n\nIF READY TO PROCEED:\n\u2192 Route to \"Business Model Options\"\n\n## If They Say \"It Seems Too Simple to Work\"\n\n\"I understand \u2013 but sometimes the most elegant solutions are simple in application. The mechanism is actually sophisticated: specific ridge patterns calibrated to stimulate mechanoreceptors at precise frequencies, modulating neural signaling through established pathways. The Nobel Prize work showed how these touch pathways affect the entire nervous system. Would you like to see the mechanism documentation?\"\n\n## What NOT to Do\n- Don't over-explain the science to address this\n- Focus on patient EXPERIENCE, not mechanism\n- Offer a sample as proof"

Best if you already retail products.\n\n**AFFILIATE** - We give you a unique referral link or code. You recommend, patients order from us, you earn commission on every sale. No inventory, no transactions. Best if you just want to recommend and not deal with retail.\n\n**HYBRID** - Mix of both. Stock your top 2-3 products on hand, use affiliate for everything else.

The patch patterns are engineered to specific dimensions that activate these channels, which then modulate neural signaling via the Gate Control pathway and descending pain inhibition.\n\nThe simplicity is the delivery method.

## VIDEO ANALYSIS

### 1. MAIN TOPIC & TECHNIQUE

**Effective Sales Follow-Up Strategy**
The video emphasizes the necessity of multiple, strategic follow-ups to convert prospects, aiming to be effective without being annoying.

### 2. KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

The speaker outlines three main steps to enhance follow-up effectiveness:

#### Framework 1: Warm Up Your Follow-Up with Mutual Connections

*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  Identify any mutually known contacts with your prospect.
    2.  Utilize platforms like LinkedIn: "If you take a look on LinkedIn under your profile, and you then go and look at somebody else's profile, it will show you under their profile, right under their picture, people that you both know."
    3.  Mention the mutual connection's name in your follow-up message.
*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:**
    *   It makes the initial outreach "seem a little easier for you" and helps "get the attention of your prospect."
    *   Leverages existing trust and familiarity, turning a cold outreach into a warmer one.

#### Framework 2: Structured Follow-Up Process with Easing In

*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  **Develop a Follow-Up Process:** "Have a structured follow-up process. Now there's two parts to this one. First off, have a process." This prevents laziness and ensures consistency. "You don't have to think about it."
    2.  **Track Your Progress:** "you can track this in a spreadsheet, you can put this as a note in your CRM as to what level they're at as far as follow-up."
    3.  **Ease Your Way In with Timing:** "The structure of your follow-up has been proven to be something that should ultimately help your prospect and slowly ease you into their life, not overwhelm them."
        *   Start with a follow-up the next day after an initial meeting.
        *   Wait a week for the second follow-up.
        *   Wait 4-5 days for the third follow-up.
        *   Then, gradually narrow the time between subsequent follow-ups (e.g., 3-4 days).
        *   "So narrow the time between your follow-up because what you're doing is easing your way into their life. You're reminding them that you're here..."
*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:**
    *   **Process:** Reduces decision fatigue for the salesperson, ensuring no prospect is forgotten and each interaction is purposeful.
    *   **Easing In:** Prevents the prospect from feeling overwhelmed or spammed. It gradually builds familiarity and keeps you top-of-mind without being intrusive, seen as "a welcome guest."

#### Framework 3: Always Add Value

*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  For each follow-up, ask yourself: "What can you share at each step that would be useful? That would be helpful?"
    2.  If unsure what to share: "ask existing clients or customers, 'Hey, what would you appreciate if you didn't know me and I was reaching out to you?'"
    3.  Ensure every follow-up offers something beneficial or relevant, rather than just asking for a response.
*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:**
    *   "if you're not adding enough value, if you're not being helpful or useful enough to them, why would they give you any of their time?"
    *   Shifts the dynamic from "pestering" to genuinely assisting. Prospects are more likely to engage with someone who consistently provides value and insights. It builds a perception of expertise and generosity.
    *   "If you give and give as you move forward... which you ultimately do, is build the idea in your prospect's mind that, well, if I get this much now, what am I going to get actually to work with them?"

### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS

*   **Opening/Warm-up (using mutual connection):**
    *   "Hey, it looks like we're both connected with Bob."
    *   "It looks like we're both connected with Susan."
*   **Initial Follow-Up (after a meeting, delivering promised info):**
    *   "Thanks for the meeting, here's information I promised you."
*   **Value-Add Follow-Up (assessment example):**
    *   "Appreciated the conversation. A lot of our clients actually begin the relationship with a little assessment to see if our product or service is a good fit for them. I've included it here. Feel free to fill it out, be happy to discuss with you when appropriate."
*   **Value-Add Ideas (general):**
    *   "shares an additional resource."
    *   "shares an introduction to somebody else."
    *   "provides a free demonstration or a free sample."

### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING

The video addresses an internal objection/perception rather than external customer objections:

*   **Common Objection (implied, from salesperson's perspective):** "I feel like I'm pestering them by following up so many times." or "Why would they give me their time if they haven't responded yet?"
*   **Recommended Reframe/Psychology:** "if you're not adding enough value, if you're not being helpful or useful enough to them, why would they give you any of their time?" The solution isn't to stop following up, but to ensure each follow-up *adds value*. When you add value, you're seen as "a welcome guest," not a pest.

### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1.  **Persistence is Key:** It often takes **5 to 18** follow-ups to get a prospect to respond and move forward.
2.  **Leverage Mutual Connections:** Use LinkedIn to find and mention shared contacts to warm up your initial outreach and gain attention.
3.  **Structure Your Follow-Ups:** Create a predefined, multi-step process for all prospects to avoid getting off track and ensure consistent engagement.
4.  **Strategic Timing:** Don't follow up too frequently initially. Ease in by spreading out early follow-ups (e.g., Day 1, then a week later), then gradually narrow the time between touches as you progress.
5.  **Always Add Value:** Each follow-up should offer something useful, helpful, or insightful to the prospect, transforming the interaction from an ask to a give.

### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION

Here's how these techniques can be specifically applied to selling Super Patch wellness products:

#### 1. Warm Up Your Follow-Up with Mutual Connections (Super Patch)

*   **Application:** When reaching out to a new prospect or following up on an initial connection, check their LinkedIn profile for mutual connections.
*   **Specific Script/Example:**
    *   "Hi [Prospect Name], I hope you're having a great week! I noticed we're both connected with [Mutual Connection's Name], who I know is very interested in holistic wellness/natural pain relief. Speaking of which, I was following up on our recent chat about how Super Patch technology could assist you with [their specific pain point, e.g., knee pain/sleep disturbance]. Building on our conversation, I thought you might find [value-add, e.g., this testimonial from someone with a similar issue] helpful."

#### 2. Structured Follow-Up Process with Easing In (Super Patch)

*   **Application:** Design a 5-18 step follow-up sequence in your CRM or a simple spreadsheet. Track each prospect's journey. Use varied methods (email, text, call, social media message).
*   **Specific Timing/Example (after an initial consultation/interest):**
    *   **Day 1 (Email/Text):** "Thanks for chatting today, [Prospect Name]! Here's the link to our Super Patch technology overview we discussed, along with the information on the [specific patch, e.g., REM Patch] that best fits your needs." (Delivering promised info).
    *   **Day 7 (Email/Social Media Message):** "Just checking in, [Prospect Name]. I was thinking about your challenges with [sleep/energy/pain] and came across this insightful article on [relevant topic, e.g., 'The Science of Neuro-Acupressure'] that I thought you might appreciate. It really highlights how our patches work without chemicals or drugs." (Adding educational value).
    *   **Day 12 (Voicemail/Text):** "Hi [Prospect Name], this is [Your Name] from Super Patch. Following up on our last conversation. I just heard a fantastic testimonial from a client who experienced [specific positive outcome, e.g., 'their best night's sleep in years'] after using the [specific patch]. It reminded me of your situation, and I thought it might inspire you. Call me back if you have any questions or want to discuss a trial." (Adding social proof/testimonial value).
    *   **Day 15 (Email with Offer):** "Still exploring options for [their problem]? We have a special limited-time offer on our [specific Starter Pack] that could be a perfect way for you to experience the Super Patch difference firsthand. It includes [key benefits]. Let me know if you'd like me to send you the details." (Adding offer/call to action).
    *   **Day 18 (Text/Call with Alternative):** "Hi [Prospect Name], it's [Your Name] again. Wanted to touch base one last time about the Super Patch for your [problem]. If now isn't the right time, or if you found a different solution, please let me know so I can close out your file. Otherwise, I'm here if anything changes!" (The "breakup" message, often prompts a response).

#### 3. Always Add Value (Super Patch)

*   **Application:** Before each follow-up, strategize what specific value you can offer related to Super Patch and wellness.
*   **Specific Examples for Super Patch:**
    *   **Assessment:** "Appreciated our chat about your [pain/sleep issue]. Many of our clients start with a quick self-assessment to pinpoint which Super Patch might be best for their specific needs. I've included a link to it here – it only takes a few minutes, and I'd be happy to review your results with you if you'd like."
    *   **Educational Content:** Share links to blog posts, scientific articles, or short videos explaining the neuro-acupressure technology, benefits of specific patches, or general wellness tips (e.g., "5 Ways to Improve Sleep Naturally").
    *   **Testimonials/Success Stories:** Provide specific, relatable stories from other users who found relief for similar issues. "I thought of you when I read this incredible story from a fellow athlete who found significant pain relief with the [Freedom Patch] for their [similar injury]. See how it helped them here."
    *   **Free Sample/Demonstration (if applicable):** Offer a small trial pack or a single patch for them to experience firsthand. "I'm so confident in the Super Patch technology, I'd love to send you a complimentary [specific patch] to try for yourself. No strings attached, just want you to feel the difference. What's the best mailing address for you?"
    *   **Invitation to a Webinar/Event:** If you host virtual or in-person events about wellness or Super Patch. "We're hosting a free online workshop next week on 'Optimizing Your Energy Naturally.' Thought it might be right up your alley, as we touched on energy during our call. Here's the registration link."
    *   **Introduction:** If appropriate, connect them with a local wellness professional, a satisfied customer, or someone else in your network who shares their interests or challenges.

## What to Listen For
Their answers tell you what to emphasize later:
- Pain complaints → Lead with Freedom
- Sleep issues → Lead with REM
- Stress/anxiety → Lead with Peace
- Balance/mobility → Lead with Liberty
- Fatigue/energy → Lead with Boost

## After 2-3 Questions
Transition to presentation:
"Okay, based on what you're telling me about your patients, I think there's something really relevant here..."

## What NOT to Do
- Don't rush through questions
- Don't interrupt their answers
- Let them tell you what matters to THEM"""

## The Hook for {content['title']}s

## Product Details to Share (based on their needs)

**FREEDOM (Pain):**
- Double-blind RCT, 118 participants, 14 days
- Published in Pain Therapeutics journal
- Significant pain reduction AND range of motion improvement
- Registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06505005
- For {content['title']}s: "{content['top_products'].get('Freedom', 'Drug-free pain relief')}"

**REM (Sleep):**
- HARMONI study, 113 participants
- 46% faster sleep onset (69 min → 37 min)
- 80% of participants stopped sleep medications
- No morning grogginess, no tolerance buildup
- For {content['title']}s: "{content['top_products'].get('REM', 'Sleep support')}"

**PEACE (Stress):**
- Parasympathetic nervous system support
- Not sedating - just calming
- For {content['title']}s: "{content['top_products'].get('Peace', 'Stress reduction')}"

## How VTT Works (explain simply)
"The patches have these raised geometric patterns that stimulate nerve receptors in your skin - mechanoreceptors. Same touch pathways recognized by the 2021 Nobel Prize. It signals through neural pathways to support [pain relief/sleep/etc.]. No drugs, nothing absorbed - just signaling."

1. Acknowledge their concern (don't dismiss)

- "Okay, I'm sensing hesitation - that's fine. What's the main concern?"

## After Addressing
If satisfied → Move to business model
If still skeptical → Offer sample
If firm no → Handle gracefully, leave door open

## What NOT to Do
- Don't argue or get defensive
- Don't keep pushing the same point
- Don't dismiss their concern"""

Present the options:

"So let me tell you how {content['title']}s typically work with us. Three options:

**WHOLESALE** - You buy at 25% off retail, stock in your practice, sell to patients. You control pricing, keep the margin. Best if you already retail products.

**AFFILIATE** - We give you a unique link. You recommend, patients order from us, you earn commission. No inventory, no transactions. Best if you just want to recommend.

**HYBRID** - Stock your top products (Freedom, REM), affiliate for everything else. Best of both worlds."

## Based on Earlier Discovery
- If they already retail products → Suggest wholesale
- If they don't want to handle retail → Suggest affiliate
- If unsure → Suggest starting with affiliate (no risk)

## After They Choose
Move to scheduling the in-person sales visit.

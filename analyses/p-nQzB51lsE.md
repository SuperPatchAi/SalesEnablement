## VIDEO ANALYSIS

### 1. MAIN TOPIC & TECHNIQUE
The primary sales concept taught is **"The Psychology of Selling: The 13 Steps to Selling That Actually Works."** It focuses on understanding and leveraging human psychology to build rapport, uncover true needs, and guide prospects toward a natural buying decision without resorting to traditional, high-pressure sales tactics.

### 2. KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

The video outlines 13 steps for effective selling:

**1. Drop the enthusiasm**
*   **Step-by-step process:** Reduce overly excited or enthusiastic demeanor. Adopt a calm, genuine, and authentic tone.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** "Reactance" – people resist being pushed. Over-enthusiasm can make you seem inauthentic, desperate, or like you're trying too hard to sell, which triggers resistance in prospects. Being real and genuine builds trust.

**2. They don't want the pitch**
*   **Step-by-step process:** Prioritize understanding the prospect's needs and concerns through conversation *before* presenting any solution or pitch.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** A common reason sales are lost is that the salesperson doesn't truly understand the prospect's needs. Prospects want to feel understood and engaged in a conversation about *their* situation, not lectured about a product. This builds rapport and ensures any eventual pitch is relevant.

**3. Pressure is a "No-No"**
*   **Step-by-step process:** Remove all pressure from the selling situation. Focus on asking questions to *determine if there's a fit*, rather than trying to persuade them.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** Similar to "Reactance," putting pressure on a prospect makes them pull back and resist. A no-pressure approach allows them to feel in control and more open to genuine conversation.

**4. It's about them, not you**
*   **Step-by-step process:** Shift the entire conversation focus from your offerings to the prospect's world: their concerns, challenges, goals, and what matters most to them.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** "WIIFM" (What's In It For Me?). Prospects care about themselves and their problems, not your product or service. By focusing on *their* issues, you make the conversation valuable and engaging for them, leading to increased trust and willingness to open up.

**5. Get in their shoes**
*   **Step-by-step process:** Actively try to understand the buying experience from the prospect's perspective. Consider what they care about, their challenges, and why they might choose you or a competitor.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** Top performers are effective at taking the perspective of their buyers. Empathy helps you anticipate their thoughts, concerns, and decision-making process, allowing for more relevant and impactful communication.

**6. We need to create value through our questions**
*   **Step-by-step process:** When a prospect states a problem, resist the urge to immediately offer a solution. Instead, ask deeper, insightful questions that help them explore the problem's implications and potential impact.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** Like a psychologist, you guide the prospect to uncover their own insights and the depth of their problem. This process of self-discovery makes them feel heard and validates the problem, increasing their perceived need for a solution.

**7. "No" isn't bad**
*   **Step-by-step process:** Embrace "no" as a natural part of the process. Actively seek to disqualify prospects who are not a good fit as early as possible.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** A significant portion of prospects will never be a good fit. By quickly identifying these non-fits, you save time and reduce wasted effort. It also removes pressure from the prospect ("I'm not sure if this is a fit...").

**8. If you feel it, say it**
*   **Step-by-step process:** If you sense something is off (e.g., distraction, disinterest, hesitation), address it directly and gently.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** Transparency and directness can disarm hidden objections or unspoken issues. It shows honesty and creates an environment where the prospect feels comfortable being honest in return. Often, they will re-engage more fully once the unspoken issue is addressed.

**9. Get deep into their challenges**
*   **Step-by-step process:** Think like a doctor, not a salesperson. Go beyond surface-level problems to understand the underlying core issues and implications. Use effective questions to "dig deeper."
*   **Psychology/Principle:** Analogous to an iceberg, prospects only show the tip of their problems. Effective questioning uncovers the hidden, more impactful challenges, allowing for a more comprehensive and valuable solution.

**10. Tie those challenges to value**
*   **Step-by-step process:** Once you've thoroughly explored their challenges, ask questions that quantify the potential value or impact of solving those challenges.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** Prospects are driven by outcomes and benefits. By having *them* articulate the financial or tangible value of resolving their issues (e.g., increased revenue, profitability, savings, improved well-being), you make the solution's worth concrete and personally relevant. It becomes "their number," increasing ownership and buy-in.

**11. Make it a two-way dialogue**
*   **Step-by-step process:** Ensure the conversation is a continuous back-and-forth, with roughly equal speaking time for both parties. Avoid monologuing.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** People are most engaged when they are speaking. A two-way dialogue keeps the prospect actively involved, preventing them from mentally checking out. This frequent engagement also creates "mini-buys" throughout the conversation, making the final decision feel natural.

**12. Budget comes later**
*   **Step-by-step process:** Postpone discussions about price, cost, or budget until after you have thoroughly understood their challenges and tied those challenges to specific, quantified value.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** Discussing budget too early, before the value is established, positions your offering as a commodity. By delaying, you ensure the prospect understands the potential return on investment, making the price seem like a worthwhile investment rather than just an expense.

**13. Feedback loops**
*   **Step-by-step process:** Throughout the conversation, especially after presenting information or explaining something, use small, re-engaging questions to check for understanding and continued interest.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** These "mini-questions" (like "Does that make sense?") act as micro-commitments, continuously pulling the prospect back into the conversation and confirming alignment. They prevent assumptions, allow for clarification, and build momentum, making the final "close" feel like a natural next step rather than a pressured decision.

### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS

*   **Opening/Introduction (Dropping Enthusiasm):**
    *   "Hi, my name's Mark, it's nice to meet you." (Preferred, genuine)
    *   *(Avoid: "Hey! Mark Wayshak, how are you?!" - overly enthusiastic)*

*   **Discovery Questions (Avoiding the Pitch, Getting in Their Shoes, Creating Value through Questions, Getting Deep into Challenges):**
    *   "So, tell me, where are you feeling that pain?" (Analogy to doctor)
    *   "What's going on?"
    *   "What's really important to them?" (Referring to prospect's challenges)
    *   "What do those challenges actually look like to them?"
    *   "Help me understand why you say that."
    *   "How's that make you feel?"
    *   "What would you say this challenge is costing you?"
    *   "If you were able to solve this problem, what would it mean in additional revenue/profitability?"
    *   "George, if you were able to solve these challenges that you're facing, what would it mean in additional revenue to the organization?"
    *   "Tell me more about those challenges."
    *   "Help me understand what's going on."

*   **Objection/Resistance Responses (If You Feel It, Say It):**
    *   *(If sensing distraction)* "George, I really appreciate you sitting with me today, but it seems like you're pretty distracted right now. Is this maybe not a good time to be talking about this?"
    *   *(If sensing disinterest)* "George, I get the sense that this just doesn't seem to be of a lot of interest to you. Is that fair to say?"
    *   *(If they say "No" to interest)* "Okay, well tell me why you say that."

*   **Budget Discussion (Comes Later):**
    *   "Typically, a solution based on what I'm hearing the challenges are, could range anywhere from $100,000 to $500,000. Where on that spectrum could you see yourself fitting?"

*   **Re-engagement/Feedback Loops (Two-Way Dialogue):**
    *   "So, now that I've shown you that, I want to understand, does that make sense based on what we're talking about?"
    *   "Do you see what I'm saying?"
    *   "Does that work for you?"
    *   *(When speaking for more than ~60 seconds)* "So, before I go any further, does this make any sense?"
    *   *(Final close after value is built)* "What would you like to do next?"

### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING
The video directly addresses *how to approach* potential objections or signs of disengagement rather than listing specific objections.

*   **Common objections mentioned:** Implied distractions, disinterest, or a general "no" that isn't based on a lack of fit.
*   **Recommended responses (exact wording provided):**
    *   For **distraction**: "George, I really appreciate you sitting with me today, but it seems like you're pretty distracted right now. Is this maybe not a good time to be talking about this?"
    *   For **disinterest**: "George, I get the sense that this just doesn't seem to be of a lot of interest to you. Is that fair to say?"
    *   For a general "no" (or lack of perceived fit): "Okay, well tell me why you say that." (This encourages deeper understanding rather than immediate counter-argument).
*   **The reframe or psychology behind each response:**
    *   These responses utilize transparency and an investigative approach. Instead of trying to "overcome" an objection, the salesperson "feels it and says it," inviting the prospect to articulate their real feelings or reasons. This removes pressure and often leads to the prospect clarifying their interest or providing valuable insights into their concerns. The goal is to determine if a genuine fit exists, not to force one. Embracing "no" and disqualifying quickly is seen as a victory.

### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1.  **Be Genuine, Not Enthusiastic:** Authenticity builds trust. Drop excessive excitement and focus on being real to avoid triggering prospect resistance.
2.  **Conversation Over Pitch:** Prioritize understanding your prospect's needs and challenges through active listening and deep questioning before ever presenting a solution. The pitch comes *after* value is established and fit is confirmed.
3.  **Remove All Pressure:** Avoid pushing prospects; it triggers "reactance" and makes them pull away. Instead, guide them through a collaborative dialogue to determine if a genuine fit exists.
4.  **Focus on "What's In It For Them":** Frame all discussions around the prospect's problems, goals, and the quantifiable value they would gain, rather than your product's features or your company's benefits.
5.  **Use Feedback Loops Constantly:** Integrate small, re-engaging questions throughout the conversation to ensure understanding, maintain engagement, and create continuous "mini-buys," leading to a natural and easy close.

### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION

These techniques can be powerfully applied to selling Super Patch wellness products in a direct sales/network marketing context:

1.  **Drop the Enthusiasm:**
    *   **Application:** Instead of immediately exclaiming, "Oh my gosh, these patches are life-changing! You HAVE to try them!" try a calmer approach.
    *   **Script Example:** "I've been learning a lot about how our bodies work and discovered these really interesting wellness patches. Many people I know have seen great results for [specific issue]. I'd love to share more, but only if it sounds like something that might genuinely interest you or address a need you have." This feels less like a hard sell and more like an informed friend sharing knowledge.

2.  **They Don't Want the Pitch:**
    *   **Application:** Don't start with a rundown of how the patches work or all the different types.
    *   **Script Example (instead of pitching):** "Many people try Super Patch for issues like [mention common issues: sleep, pain, stress]. Are any of those areas you've been looking to improve, or do you have other wellness goals on your mind right now?" This opens a dialogue, not a monologue.

3.  **Pressure is a "No-No":**
    *   **Application:** Avoid urgency or scarcity tactics. Don't push for an immediate purchase or commitment.
    *   **Script Example:** "I'm happy to share information and answer any questions you have about Super Patch. It's not for everyone, but if it sounds like it could be a fit for what you're looking for, we can explore it further. If not, no worries at all."

4.  **It's About Them, Not You:**
    *   **Application:** Focus entirely on *their* pain points, sleep struggles, energy dips, stress levels, or recovery needs.
    *   **Script Example:** "I understand you've been having trouble with [back pain / falling asleep]. How has that been impacting your daily life/energy/mood? What's the biggest challenge that creates for you?"

5.  **Get in Their Shoes:**
    *   **Application:** Understand their current solutions for pain, sleep, etc., and why they might be dissatisfied.
    *   **Script Example:** "When you're dealing with [pain/lack of sleep], what strategies have you tried so far? What did you like or dislike about those? What's your ideal outcome if you could find a perfect solution?"

6.  **Create Value Through Your Questions:**
    *   **Application:** When they mention a problem, drill down on the *impact* of that problem.
    *   **Script Example (instead of "Our patches help pain!"):** "You mentioned chronic knee pain. What's that pain preventing you from doing? How often does it keep you from enjoying activities like [walking, playing with grandkids]? How does that impact your overall quality of life?"

7.  **"No" Isn't Bad:**
    *   **Application:** Don't fear a "no." Use it to clarify or politely move on if it's truly not a fit.
    *   **Script Example:** If someone says, "I'm just not interested in patches," you can respond: "Okay, I appreciate your honesty. Just to be clear, is it the idea of patches specifically, or are you generally not looking for new wellness solutions right now?" (Clarifies the 'no'). Or if it's a clear no, "Thanks for letting me know, I appreciate your time!"

8.  **If You Feel It, Say It:**
    *   **Application:** If someone seems disengaged or skeptical.
    *   **Script Example:** "I'm sensing a little hesitation when I mention the technology. Is there something about it that sounds too good to be true, or a particular concern you have?" (Addresses skepticism directly).

9.  **Get Deep Into Their Challenges:**
    *   **Application:** Don't just hear "I have trouble sleeping." Ask *why* it's a problem.
    *   **Script Example:** "When you say you're tired, what does that feel like throughout your day? Does it affect your focus, your mood, your patience? What would a good night's sleep consistently allow you to do that you can't do now?"

10. **Tie Those Challenges to Value:**
    *   **Application:** Quantify the impact of solving their problem with the patches.
    *   **Script Example:** "If you were able to finally get consistent, restful sleep, what would that mean for you in terms of your energy, your productivity, or even just enjoying your hobbies more? What's the value of feeling truly rested every day?" This gets them to think about the *benefit* in their own terms.

11. **Make it a Two-Way Dialogue:**
    *   **Application:** After explaining how a patch works, pause and ask.
    *   **Script Example:** "So, the technology in the patches essentially works by stimulating your nerve endings to send signals to your brain to [e.g., promote relaxation]. Does that explanation make sense, or would you like me to clarify anything?"

12. **Budget Comes Later:**
    *   **Application:** Don't lead with patch prices. Build the value first.
    *   **Script Example:** After tying challenges to value (e.g., better sleep means more energy, less pain means more activity), you can say: "Given the potential impact of getting [better sleep/pain relief], what kind of investment would you consider reasonable to achieve those results?" or "Based on the value we've identified, these solutions typically range from [e.g., $50-$150] per month depending on your specific needs. Where does that sound like it might fit for you?"

13. **Feedback Loops:**
    *   **Application:** Use these throughout any explanation or discussion.
    *   **Script Example:** "Does that resonate with your experience?" "Am I understanding your situation correctly?" "Does that sound like something you'd be open to exploring?" "Before we move on, are there any questions about that?" "What would you like to do next?" (For the natural close).

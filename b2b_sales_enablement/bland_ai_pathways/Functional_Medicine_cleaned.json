I'm reaching out to functional medicine practitioners because you understand systems biology \u2013 how one intervention can affect multiple pathways. Our Vibrotactile Technology works through mechanoreceptor activation to modulate neural signaling. It's a non-pharmaceutical approach that doesn't compete with your root-cause work. Would you be interested in learning how other FM practitioners are integrating this?\"\n\nAfter delivering the opening:\n- If they say they're busy or ask to call back later \u2192 route to \"Schedule Callback\"\n- If they ask who you are or what SuperPatch is \u2192 route to \"Company Introduction\"\n- If they show interest or say yes \u2192 route to \"Discovery Questions\"\n- If they say no or aren't interested \u2192 route to \"Soft Objection Handler\"\n",

Patients feel great after treatment, then within days they're back to square one. They start to wonder if the care is working - when really, it's the home support that's missing.\"\n\n**SOLVE** - Introduce SuperPatch:\n\"That's where SuperPatch comes in. Our Freedom patch uses Vibrotactile Technology - a drug-free approach that works with the body's own neural pathways.

But consider this: symptomatic support doesn't have to mean suppression. VTT works with neural pathways, not against them. It's supporting the nervous system's own regulation while you address root causes. And unlike drugs, when the root cause is resolved, you can discontinue without rebound or dependency. How do you currently support patients symptomatically during treatment?\"\n\n**If they say: \"My patients are already on too many things.\"**\nRespond: \"That's exactly why this might help. Unlike another supplement to take, process, and interact with everything else, this is a simple patch that works through skin receptors. No pills to time, no absorption to optimize, no interactions to worry about. For patients with protocol fatigue, this is one intervention that doesn't add complexity. What would simplification mean for patient compliance?\"\n\n**If they say: \"I need to understand the mechanism better.\"**\nRespond: \"Of course \u2013 that's the FM approach. The mechanism is mechanoreceptor activation, primarily through Meissner's corpuscles and Merkel cells. This stimulates Piezo1/Piezo2 ion channels, which modulate neural signaling through established pathways like Gate Control Theory. There's no chemical transduction \u2013 it's purely physical signal modul"

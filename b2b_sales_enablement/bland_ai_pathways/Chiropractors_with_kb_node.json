I'm reaching out to chiropractors who are looking for drug-free solutions to support their patients between adjustments. Do you have two minutes?\"\n\nLISTEN FOR:\n- If they say they're busy or ask to call back \u2192 acknowledge and ask for a better time\n- If they ask who you are or what SuperPatch is \u2192 briefly explain\n- If they show interest or say yes \u2192 thank them and transition to learning about their practice\n- If they say no or not interested \u2192 be polite, ask if timing is the issue\n\nBE NATURAL: Don't read a script. Adapt your greeting based on time of day. If they sound rushed, be brief. If they're chatty, engage a bit.\n\nTONE: Warm, professional, respectful of their time.

If they ask about science, lean into the clinical evidence. If they ask about business, mention we work with practitioners.\n\nAFTER EXPLAINING: Ask if they'd like to hear how it could help their patients, or if they have specific questions.\n\nTONE: Knowledgeable but not lecturing. You're sharing, not selling."

Pain patients \u2192 Freedom. Sleep issues \u2192 REM. Balance/seniors \u2192 Liberty.\n\nEXAMPLE: \"I'd love to learn a bit about your practice so I can share what's most relevant. What types of patients do you mostly see?\"\n\nDON'T: Rush through questions. If they share something interesting, follow up on it.\n\nWHEN READY: Once you understand their needs, transition to showing how SuperPatch addresses them."

PROBLEM - Acknowledge their challenge:\n\"From what you've shared, it sounds like the challenge isn't what happens in your office - it's what happens when patients go home...\"\n\n2. AGITATE - Show you understand the impact:\n\"That creates a frustrating cycle - patients feel great after treatment, then reach for medications between visits...\"\n\n3. SOLVE - Introduce SuperPatch:\n\"That's where SuperPatch comes in. Our Freedom patch uses Vibrotactile Technology - completely drug-free, works with the body's neural pathways...\"\n\n4. EXPAND - Tailor to their patients:\n- Pain patients \u2192 Freedom patch (RESTORE study)\n- Sleep issues \u2192 REM patch (HARMONI study)  \n- Balance/seniors \u2192 Liberty patch (Balance study)\n\nBE CONVERSATIONAL: Adapt based on their reactions. If they seem skeptical, offer to share the research. If excited, move toward how to work together.\n\nHANDLE QUESTIONS: If they ask about evidence, dive into the clinical studies. If they ask about cost, discuss value."

I'm reaching out to integrative medicine physicians who are looking for evidence-based alternatives to pharmaceuticals. Our Vibrotactile Technology patches have completed peer-reviewed clinical trials - the Freedom patch has an RCT for pain, and the REM patch has a study showing 80% of participants stopped sleep medications. Would you be interested in adding an evidence-based non-pharmaceutical option to your toolkit?\"\n\n## Adapt Based on Response:\n\nIF THEY SAY \"SURE\" / \"TELL ME MORE\":\n\u2192 Great! Transition to discovery\n\"Awesome, thanks! So I can share what's most relevant - tell me about your practice?\"\n\nIF THEY ASK \"WHO IS THIS?\":\n\u2192 Brief intro\n\"Oh sorry - I'm Jennifer from SuperPatch. We make drug-free patches that work through Vibrotactile Technology. A lot of integrative medicine physicians use them to clinical-grade evidence for a drug-free technology - the best of both worlds.\"\n\nIF \"I'M BUSY\":\n\u2192 Schedule callback\n\"Totally understand - you've got patients! When would be better for a quick 10-minute call?\"\n\nIF \"NOT INTERESTED\":\n\u2192 Gentle probe\n\"No problem! Just curious - is it that you're all set with what you recommend, or more of a timing thing?\"\n\n## What NOT to Do\n- Don't sound scripted\n- Don't keep talking if they want to respond\n- Match their energy level"

But they also want credibility. Many complementary options lack the evidence you need. SuperPatch gives you both: Freedom has a peer-reviewed RCT in Pain Therapeutics, registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. REM showed 80% stopped sleep medications. This is clinical-grade evidence for a drug-free technology.\n\n## Product Details to Share (based on their needs)\n\n**FREEDOM (Pain):**\n- Double-blind RCT, 118 participants, 14 days\n- Published in Pain Therapeutics journal\n- Significant pain reduction AND range of motion improvement\n- Registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06505005\n- For integrative medicine physicians: \"Pain relief - Peer-reviewed RCT, Pain Therapeutics journal, ClinicalTrials.gov registered\"\n\n**REM (Sleep):**\n- HARMONI study, 113 participants\n- 46% faster sleep onset (69 min \u2192 37 min)\n- 80% of participants stopped sleep medications\n- No morning grogginess, no tolerance buildup\n- For integrative medicine physicians: \"Sleep support - HARMONI study, 80% stopped sleep medications\"\n\n**PEACE (Stress):**\n- Parasympathetic nervous system support\n- Not sedating - just calming\n- For integrative medicine physicians: \"Stress reduction\"\n\n## How VTT Works (explain simply)\n\"The patches have these raised geometric patterns that stimulate nerve receptors in your skin - mechanoreceptors. Same touch pathways recognized by the 2021 Nobel Prize. It signals through neural pathways to support [pain relief/sleep/etc.]. No drugs, nothing absorbed - just signaling.\"\n\n## After Presenting\nIf interested \u2192 Talk about business model\nIf questions \u2192 Address them\nIf skeptical \u2192 Handle objection"

The Freedom patch has a peer-reviewed RCT published in Pain Therapeutics. The technology is based on mechanoreceptor science - the same field that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine. I can send you the clinical study.\n\n**\"FITS ALONGSIDE CONVENTIONAL\":**\nIt fits as first-line or adjunct. Because it's non-pharmaceutical with no interactions, you can layer it with conventional treatments or try it first. For pain: 'Let's try this before escalating to medications.' For sleep: part of a reduction strategy.\n\n**\"PATIENTS SKEPTICAL OF PATCHES\":**\nUnderstandable if they've tried transdermal drug patches. This is fundamentally different - not delivering a substance. The mechanism is physical pattern stimulation, not chemical delivery. Framing it as 'Nobel Prize-recognized technology' often helps.\n\n**\"NEED MORE THAN ONE STUDY\":**\nWe have three published studies - RESTORE for pain, HARMONI for sleep, and a Balance study for Liberty. Plus ongoing research. Would you be comfortable with a small trial with selected patients?\n\n## General Approach\n1. Acknowledge their concern (don't dismiss)\n2. Address it directly\n3. Redirect to next step\n\n## Recovery Phrases\nIf conversation gets awkward:\n- \"Fair point. Let me back up...\"\n- \"You know what, I hear you. What would make this a no-brainer for you?\"\n- \"Okay, I'm sensing hesitation - that's fine. What's the main concern?\"\n\n## After Addressing\nIf satisfied \u2192 Move to business model\nIf still skeptical \u2192 Offer sample\nIf firm no \u2192 Handle gracefully, leave door open\n\n## What NOT to Do\n- Don't argue or get defensive\n- Don't keep pushing the same point\n- Don't dismiss their concern"

Best if you already retail products.\n\n**AFFILIATE** - We give you a unique link. You recommend, patients order from us, you earn commission. No inventory, no transactions. Best if you just want to recommend.\n\n**HYBRID** - Stock your top products (Freedom, REM), affiliate for everything else. Best of both worlds.\"\n\n## Based on Earlier Discovery\n- If they already retail products \u2192 Suggest wholesale\n- If they don't want to handle retail \u2192 Suggest affiliate\n- If unsure \u2192 Suggest starting with affiliate (no risk)\n\n## After They Choose\nMove to scheduling the in-person sales visit.\n\n\"Perfect.

## 1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW (Clinical Focus)

**Focus** provides drug-free concentration and attention support using Vibrotactile Technology (VTT). Ideal for patients seeking cognitive support without stimulant medications, Focus works through neural pathway activation based on Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research (2021).

### Clinical Mechanism
Focus utilizes specialized VTT ridge patterns that:
- Activate mechanoreceptors influencing cognitive pathways
- Support attention and concentration neural networks
- Enhance mental clarity without stimulant effects
- Provide sustained focus without dependency

### Key Differentiators
| Feature | Stimulant Medications | VTT (Focus) |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|
| Mechanism | Dopamine/norepinephrine | Neural pathway activation |
| Side Effects | Common | Minimal |
| Dependency | Risk | None |
| Prescription | Required | Not needed |
| Contraindications | Many | None |

### Practice Integration Benefits
- **Non-Pharmaceutical Option:** For patients wanting drug-free support
- **Complementary:** Can be used alongside existing treatments
- **Safe Long-Term:** No tolerance or dependency development
- **Broad Application:** Students, professionals, aging patients

## 3. OPENING SCRIPTS

### 1. Cold Call
"Good morning, this is [Your Name] from Super Patch. I'm reaching out because many practitioners are looking for drug-free concentration support options. Our Focus patch uses Vibrotactile Technology – based on Nobel Prize-winning research – to support attention and mental clarity without stimulants. Do you have patients who need focus support but prefer avoiding medications?"

### 2. Email Introduction
**Subject:** Drug-Free Concentration Support for Your Patients

"Dr. [Name],

Focus and attention challenges affect patients across all ages – students, professionals, and aging adults. Many want support but prefer avoiding stimulant medications due to side effects, dependency concerns, or contraindications.

Our Focus patch uses Vibrotactile Technology – neural pathway activation rather than chemical stimulation. Drug-free, no dependency, no contraindications.

Would you be open to discussing how this could help your patients?

Best regards,
[Your Name]"

## 4. DISCOVERY QUESTIONS

1. "What percentage of your patients report focus or concentration challenges?"
2. "What do you currently recommend for patients who want drug-free cognitive support?"
3. "How do brain fog and concentration issues impact your treatment outcomes?"
4. "Are parents asking about alternatives to stimulant medications for their children?"
5. "Would a drug-free focus support option fill a gap in your practice?"

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION (2-Minute)

**[PROBLEM]**
"Concentration and focus challenges are increasingly common – from students to aging adults. Stimulant medications work for some, but many patients can't tolerate the side effects, don't want the dependency risk, or have contraindications. And for practitioners, recommending 'try harder to focus' isn't satisfying when patients genuinely struggle."

**[SOLUTION]**
"Focus uses Vibrotactile Technology to support concentration through neural pathway activation – not chemical stimulation. Based on Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research, it's completely drug-free with no stimulant side effects, no dependency risk, and no contraindications.

Patients report improved concentration and mental clarity, making it easier to function at work, school, or daily activities.

For your practice: a drug-free option for focus challenges, 25% practitioner margin, and a way to support patients who've rejected pharmaceutical options. Would you like to trial this?"

---

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Focus issues usually indicate underlying conditions."
**Response:** "You're right to look for root causes – and that's your expertise. Focus is supportive, not diagnostic or curative. It helps patients function better while you investigate and address underlying issues. Better concentration also means better compliance with your treatment protocols."

### "How can a patch improve focus without affecting brain chemistry?"
**Response:** "VTT works through mechanoreceptor activation – the same neural pathways that Nobel Prize-winning research validated in 2021. Rather than altering neurotransmitter levels like stimulants do, it supports the neural networks involved in attention through sensory input modulation. It's optimization, not pharmacological intervention."

### "Patients with attention issues need proper evaluation."
**Response:** "Absolutely agree. Focus isn't a diagnostic tool or replacement for proper evaluation. It's a supportive option for patients who've been evaluated and want drug-free support, or those whose focus challenges don't warrant pharmaceutical intervention but still impact their daily function."

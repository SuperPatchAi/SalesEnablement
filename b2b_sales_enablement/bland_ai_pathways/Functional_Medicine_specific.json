I'm reaching out to functional medicine practitioners because you understand systems biology - how one intervention can affect multiple pathways. Our Vibrotactile Technology works through mechanoreceptor activation to modulate neural signaling. It's a non-pharmaceutical approach that doesn't compete with your root-cause work. Would you be interested in learning how other FM practitioners are integrating this?\"\n\n## Adapt Based on Response:\n\nIF THEY SAY \"SURE\" / \"TELL ME MORE\":\n\u2192 Great! Transition to discovery\n\"Awesome, thanks! So I can share what's most relevant - tell me about your practice?\"\n\nIF THEY ASK \"WHO IS THIS?\":\n\u2192 Brief intro\n\"Oh sorry - I'm Jennifer from SuperPatch. We make drug-free patches that work through Vibrotactile Technology. A lot of functional medicine practitioners use them to symptomatic support while root-cause work takes effect - no metabolic load, no interactions.\"\n\nIF \"I'M BUSY\":\n\u2192 Schedule callback\n\"Totally understand - you've got patients! When would be better for a quick 10-minute call?\"\n\nIF \"NOT INTERESTED\":\n\u2192 Gentle probe\n\"No problem! Just curious - is it that you're all set with what you recommend, or more of a timing thing?\"\n\n## What NOT to Do\n- Don't sound scripted\n- Don't keep talking if they want to respond\n- Match their energy level"

You're running labs, optimizing the gut, addressing hormones, supporting detox. But meanwhile, patients are suffering. They have pain that won't wait for their GI protocol to work. They have sleep issues compounding fatigue. What are the options? More supplements adding to an already complex protocol? Pharmaceuticals creating new problems? SuperPatch offers symptomatic support with NO metabolic load, NO interactions, and NO compliance burden - while your foundational work takes effect.\n\n## Product Details to Share (based on their needs)\n\n**FREEDOM (Pain):**\n- Double-blind RCT, 118 participants, 14 days\n- Published in Pain Therapeutics journal\n- Significant pain reduction AND range of motion improvement\n- Registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06505005\n- For functional medicine practitioners: \"Pain support while addressing root causes - doesn't interfere with protocols\"\n\n**REM (Sleep):**\n- HARMONI study, 113 participants\n- 46% faster sleep onset (69 min \u2192 37 min)\n- 80% of participants stopped sleep medications\n- No morning grogginess, no tolerance buildup\n- For functional medicine practitioners: \"Sleep support while optimizing circadian biology - 80% stopped sleep meds\"\n\n**PEACE (Stress):**\n- Parasympathetic nervous system support\n- Not sedating - just calming\n- For functional medicine practitioners: \"HPA axis support - calms nervous system without adding metabolic load\"\n\n## How VTT Works (explain simply)\n\"The patches have these raised geometric patterns that stimulate nerve receptors in your skin - mechanoreceptors. Same touch pathways recognized by the 2021 Nobel Prize. It signals through neural pathways to support [pain relief/sleep/etc.]. No drugs, nothing absorbed - just signaling.\"\n\n## After Presenting\nIf interested \u2192 Talk about business model\nIf questions \u2192 Address them\nIf skeptical \u2192 Handle objection"

But symptomatic support doesn't have to mean suppression. VTT works WITH neural pathways, not against them. Unlike drugs, when the root cause is resolved, you can discontinue without rebound or dependency.\n\n**\"PATIENTS ON TOO MANY THINGS\":**\nThat's exactly why this might help. Unlike another supplement to take, process, and interact with everything else, this is a simple patch working through skin receptors. No pills to time, no absorption to optimize, no interactions. For patients with protocol fatigue, this doesn't add complexity.\n\n**\"NEED TO UNDERSTAND MECHANISM\":**\nThe mechanism is mechanoreceptor activation - Piezo1/Piezo2 ion channels modulating neural signaling through Gate Control Theory. There's no chemical transduction - purely physical signal modulation. I can send our technical mechanism paper.\n\n**\"SEEMS LIKE BAND AIDING\":**\nThink of it this way: when someone breaks their leg, you set the bone AND manage pain. The pain management doesn't prevent healing - it supports it. Similarly, VTT provides symptomatic support while your root-cause work addresses dysfunction. And because it's non-pharmaceutical, it doesn't create new problems.\n\n## General Approach\n1. Acknowledge their concern (don't dismiss)\n2. Address it directly\n3. Redirect to next step\n\n## Recovery Phrases\nIf conversation gets awkward:\n- \"Fair point. Let me back up...\"\n- \"You know what, I hear you. What would make this a no-brainer for you?\"\n- \"Okay, I'm sensing hesitation - that's fine. What's the main concern?\"\n\n## After Addressing\nIf satisfied \u2192 Move to business model\nIf still skeptical \u2192 Offer sample\nIf firm no \u2192 Handle gracefully, leave door open\n\n## What NOT to Do\n- Don't argue or get defensive\n- Don't keep pushing the same point\n- Don't dismiss their concern"

Three options:\n\n**WHOLESALE** - You buy at 25% off retail, stock in your practice, sell to patients. You control pricing, keep the margin. Best if you already retail products.\n\n**AFFILIATE** - We give you a unique link. You recommend, patients order from us, you earn commission. No inventory, no transactions. Best if you just want to recommend.\n\n**HYBRID** - Stock your top products (Freedom, REM), affiliate for everything else. Best of both worlds.\"\n\n## Based on Earlier Discovery\n- If they already retail products \u2192 Suggest wholesale\n- If they don't want to handle retail \u2192 Suggest affiliate\n- If unsure \u2192 Suggest starting with affiliate (no risk)\n\n## After They Choose\nMove to scheduling the in-person sales visit.\n\n\"Perfect. So what we'd like to do is have one of our reps stop by your practice to drop off samples and give you a quick demo. Takes about 20-30 minutes.

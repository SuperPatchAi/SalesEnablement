I'm reaching out because massage therapists understand something powerful - the impact of touch on the whole body. Our Vibrotactile Technology works through that same principle. Specialized patterns stimulate touch receptors in the skin, activating neural pathways for pain relief. It's like your work continues even after the client goes home. Sound interesting?\"\n\n## Adapt Based on Response:\n\nIF THEY SAY \"SURE\" / \"TELL ME MORE\":\n\u2192 Great! Transition to discovery\n\"Awesome, thanks! So I can share what's most relevant - tell me about your practice?\"\n\nIF THEY ASK \"WHO IS THIS?\":\n\u2192 Brief intro\n\"Oh sorry - I'm Jennifer from SuperPatch. We make drug-free patches that work through Vibrotactile Technology. A lot of LMTs use them to extend the benefits of your work to the other 23 hours when clients aren't on your table.\"\n\nIF \"I'M BUSY\":\n\u2192 Schedule callback\n\"Totally understand - you've got patients! When would be better for a quick 10-minute call?\"\n\nIF \"NOT INTERESTED\":\n\u2192 Gentle probe\n\"No problem! Just curious - is it that you're all set with what you recommend, or more of a timing thing?\"\n\n## What NOT to Do\n- Don't sound scripted\n- Don't keep talking if they want to respond\n- Match their energy level"

Clients leave feeling amazing. But within days - sometimes hours - they're back to square one. The stress builds back up, the tension returns. You can't follow them home. What happens outside your treatment room matters, and right now you don't have much influence over that. SuperPatch changes that - it's continuous, gentle touch therapy for the other 23 hours.\n\n## Product Details to Share (based on their needs)\n\n**FREEDOM (Pain):**\n- Double-blind RCT, 118 participants, 14 days\n- Published in Pain Therapeutics journal\n- Significant pain reduction AND range of motion improvement\n- Registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06505005\n- For LMTs: \"Extends pain relief between sessions - 'Wear this for the next few days'\"\n\n**REM (Sleep):**\n- HARMONI study, 113 participants\n- 46% faster sleep onset (69 min \u2192 37 min)\n- 80% of participants stopped sleep medications\n- No morning grogginess, no tolerance buildup\n- For LMTs: \"Sleep support for recovery - better sleep means better results from your work\"\n\n**PEACE (Stress):**\n- Parasympathetic nervous system support\n- Not sedating - just calming\n- For LMTs: \"Maintains relaxation benefits - keeps that calm going at home\"\n\n## How VTT Works (explain simply)\n\"The patches have these raised geometric patterns that stimulate nerve receptors in your skin - mechanoreceptors. Same touch pathways recognized by the 2021 Nobel Prize. It signals through neural pathways to support [pain relief/sleep/etc.]. No drugs, nothing absorbed - just signaling.\"\n\n## After Presenting\nIf interested \u2192 Talk about business model\nIf questions \u2192 Address them\nIf skeptical \u2192 Handle objection"

But think of it this way: when clients ask what they can do at home, you're providing a solution, not selling. It's completing their care. You probably already recommend stretches, right? This is just another tool.\n\n**\"CLIENTS WONT SPEND MORE\":**\nClients who value massage already invest in their wellness. At $3/day, it's less than their daily latte. And if it helps them maintain benefits longer, they might need fewer sessions - which saves them money.\n\n**\"TRIED RETAIL DIDNT WORK\":**\nWhat happened? Usually it's because products weren't a natural fit or were hard to explain. Patches are different - you just say 'Wear this for pain relief between sessions' and hand it to them. Nothing to explain.\n\n**\"DIFFERENT FROM MENTHOL\":**\nMenthol patches deliver a cooling substance through the skin. SuperPatch doesn't deliver anything - it's purely physical pattern stimulation. No smell, no chemicals, no mess. For clients who want truly drug-free, this is a different category.\n\n## General Approach\n1. Acknowledge their concern (don't dismiss)\n2. Address it directly\n3. Redirect to next step\n\n## Recovery Phrases\nIf conversation gets awkward:\n- \"Fair point. Let me back up...\"\n- \"You know what, I hear you. What would make this a no-brainer for you?\"\n- \"Okay, I'm sensing hesitation - that's fine. What's the main concern?\"\n\n## After Addressing\nIf satisfied \u2192 Move to business model\nIf still skeptical \u2192 Offer sample\nIf firm no \u2192 Handle gracefully, leave door open\n\n## What NOT to Do\n- Don't argue or get defensive\n- Don't keep pushing the same point\n- Don't dismiss their concern"

Three options:\n\n**WHOLESALE** - You buy at 25% off retail, stock in your practice, sell to patients. You control pricing, keep the margin. Best if you already retail products.\n\n**AFFILIATE** - We give you a unique link. You recommend, patients order from us, you earn commission. No inventory, no transactions. Best if you just want to recommend.\n\n**HYBRID** - Stock your top products (Freedom, REM), affiliate for everything else. Best of both worlds.\"\n\n## Based on Earlier Discovery\n- If they already retail products \u2192 Suggest wholesale\n- If they don't want to handle retail \u2192 Suggest affiliate\n- If unsure \u2192 Suggest starting with affiliate (no risk)\n\n## After They Choose\nMove to scheduling the in-person sales visit.\n\n\"Perfect. So what we'd like to do is have one of our reps stop by your practice to drop off samples and give you a quick demo. Takes about 20-30 minutes.

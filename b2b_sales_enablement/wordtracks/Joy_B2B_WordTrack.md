"Good morning, this is [Your Name] from Super Patch. I'm reaching out to practitioners who support patients with mood and emotional wellness and might be interested in a drug-free approach.

Our Joy patch uses Vibrotactile Technology to support mood through neural pathway activation – it's not an antidepressant, so there are no concerns about side effects or the stigma some patients feel about mood medications.

Do you have patients who could benefit from mood support but aren't candidates for psychiatric medications or prefer natural approaches?

[Listen]

Would it be helpful if I sent information on how VTT supports mood pathways and how practitioners are using Joy?"

### 2. Email Introduction Script

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION SCRIPT (2-Minute)

**(Problem-Agitate-Solve-Evidence Framework)**

**(PROBLEM)**

"Mood challenges are pervasive – affecting energy, relationships, productivity, and overall health. But many patients resist seeking help because the options feel problematic.

Antidepressant medications, while valuable for clinical depression, come with side effects that affect quality of life: sexual dysfunction, weight changes, emotional blunting. And the stigma around psychiatric medication keeps many patients from getting any support at all."

**(AGITATE)**

"This leaves a huge gap. Patients with sub-clinical mood challenges – the everyday struggles with happiness, motivation, and emotional resilience – don't warrant medication but genuinely need support.

And patients who've tried medications and discontinued due to side effects often feel hopeless. They need something that supports mood without the tradeoffs."

**(SOLVE)**

"That's why Joy is so valuable. It supports mood and emotional wellness through Vibrotactile Technology – activating neural pathways associated with positive affect without pharmaceutical intervention.

There's nothing going into the body, no neurotransmitter manipulation, no side effects. Patients experience mood support while maintaining normal sexual function, stable weight, and full emotional range."

**(EVIDENCE)**

"The science foundation is mechanoreceptor research that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine. The nervous system has pathways that influence mood regulation – VTT supports those pathways through sensory activation.

For your patients, this means mood support without the concerns that keep them from getting help. For your practice, it means filling the gap for the many patients who need emotional wellness support but won't accept or tolerate medication.

Would you like to integrate Joy into your emotional wellness protocols?"

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### 1. "Real depression requires proper treatment."

**Response:** "I completely agree – clinical depression needs comprehensive care including medication when appropriate. Joy isn't meant to treat depression.

It's valuable for emotional wellness support, sub-clinical mood challenges, and patients who want to enhance their happiness without the intensity of psychiatric medication. Does that population represent part of your practice?"

### 2. "How can a patch improve mood?"

**Response:** "Good question. The mechanism is neural pathway activation through mechanoreceptors connected to mood-regulatory systems.

VTT works with the nervous system's natural mood pathways rather than chemically manipulating neurotransmitters. It's supportive enhancement, not pharmaceutical intervention. Would understanding the mechanism help?"

### 3. "Patients expect dramatic mood changes."

**Response:** "That expectation is set by medication marketing, and it often leads to disappointment even with pharmaceuticals. Joy provides supportive wellness, not dramatic alteration.

Positioning it as 'supporting your natural capacity for happiness' sets appropriate expectations and leads to sustainable satisfaction. How do you typically frame mood support conversations?"

### 4. "What about patients with serious mood disorders?"

**Response:** "Serious mood disorders need clinical treatment. Joy isn't replacing that.

For patients with mild-moderate challenges, those who've tried medication unsuccessfully, or those who want additional support alongside treatment, Joy provides drug-free assistance. Would that application be valuable?"

### 5. "I already recommend exercise and lifestyle changes."

**Response:** "Those are foundational and essential. Joy can complement them – supporting mood while patients implement those changes.

Exercise is harder when you're low-mood. Joy can provide the boost that makes healthy behaviors more accessible. Does that layered approach make sense?"

### 6. "What about the placebo effect?"

**Response:** "Placebo is a consideration with any intervention. The VTT mechanism is based on Nobel Prize-winning science – it's a legitimate pathway.

That said, even if some benefit is placebo-enhanced, if patients feel better without side effects or dependency, that's a good outcome. Would you like to trial it with patients and evaluate their experience?"

### 7. "This seems expensive for just mood support."

**Response:** "When you consider the cost of untreated mood challenges – lost productivity, relationship strain, health impacts – and the cost of medication side effects, the value proposition changes.

Joy provides ongoing support without ongoing side effects to manage. What value do your patients place on feeling happier without pharmaceutical concerns?"

### 8. "I don't want patients avoiding proper evaluation."

**Response:** "That's an important concern. Joy should be recommended within the context of appropriate care.

You can offer Joy to patients who've been evaluated and don't warrant medication, or as support alongside your comprehensive approach. It doesn't replace evaluation – it fills a gap in your treatment options. Does that framing work?"

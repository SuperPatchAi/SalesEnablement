SuperPatch is NOT a drug. No chemicals, medications, or substances enter the body. It works with the body's own systems naturally.\n\n## How SuperPatch Works - Vibrotactile Technology (VTT)\n\nSuperPatch uses Vibrotactile Technology (VTT), based on Nobel Prize-winning research (2021) on mechanoreceptors and Piezo channels.\n\n### The Science:\n1. MECHANORECEPTOR ACTIVATION: Each patch has specialized ridge patterns that interact with the skin's mechanoreceptors (Meissner's corpuscles and Merkel cells)\n2. PIEZO CHANNEL STIMULATION: Piezo1 and Piezo2 ion channels respond to mechanical stimuli and modulate neural signaling pathways\n3. GATE CONTROL THEORY: A-beta nerve fiber activation inhibits pain signal transmission\n4. NEURAL PATHWAY MODULATION: Bidirectional communication with the central nervous system\n\nThink of it as \"Braille for your body\" - the patterns communicate with your nervous system through touch. No drugs are absorbed - the patches work by stimulating neural responses.\n\n### Application Instructions:\n1. Clean and dry the application area\n2. Peel the patch from the backing\n3. Press firmly onto skin (arm, leg, or torso)\n4. Wear for up to 24 hours\n5. Replace with new patch as needed\n\n## Key Differentiators:\n- 100% Drug-Free - No chemicals enter the body\n- All-Natural - Works with the body's own systems\n- Non-Invasive - Simply press on and wear\n- Made in USA - Quality manufacturing\n- Clinically Studied - Backed by peer-reviewed research\n- No side effects or dependency risk\n\n---\n\n# CLINICAL EVIDENCE\n\n## RESTORE Pain Study (2025) - FREEDOM Patch\n\n### Publication Details:\n- Journal: Pain Therapeutics (Pain Ther) - Peer Reviewed\n- Type: Randomized, Controlled, Double-Blind Study\n- Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06505005\n- Authors: Janet Fason, Peter Hurwitz, Jeffrey Gudin (University of Miami Miller School of Medicine)\n\n### Study Design:\n- 118 participants (58 male, 60 female)\n- 14-day duration\n- Active VTT patch (n=64) vs Placebo patch (n=54)\n- Conditions: Myofascial/musculoskeletal pain, arthritis, neuropathy/radiculopathy\n\n### Key Results:\n- PAIN SEVERITY: Significantly greater improvement in active group\n- PAIN INTERFERENCE: Significantly greater reduction in active group\n- RANGE OF MOTION: Greater objective improvement at Day 7 and Day 14\n\n### Assessment Tools Used:\n- Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) - validated instrument\n- Schober's Test (lumbar spine flexibility)\n- Goniometer measurements\n- Bubble inclinometer measurements\n\n### Conclusion Quote:\n\"These findings suggest that this non-pharmacological, noninvasive, topical VTT haptic patch can reduce pain severity and increase ROM/flexibility. Considering the multitude of serious adverse effects associated with standard pharmacological pain treatments, clinicians should consider this readily available, over-the-counter VTT patch as a potential first-line or adjunct therapy to treat pain.\"\n\n---\n\n## HARMONI Sleep Study - REM Patch\n\n### Study Design:\n- 113 participants (79 women, 34 men)\n- Average Age: 53 years\n- Duration: 14 days\n- Inclusion: Adults with difficulty falling or staying asleep\n\n### Key Results:\n- TIME TO FALL ASLEEP: Reduced from 69 minutes to 37 minutes (46% faster)\n- TOTAL SLEEP DURATION: Increased from 5 hours to 6.5 hours (+1.5 hours)\n- NIGHT WAKING: Reduced from 83% to 22% weekly (74% reduction)\n- SLEEP MEDICATION USE: 80% of participants stopped using sleep medications\n\n### Secondary Benefits:\n- Reduced daytime fatigue\n- Improved mood\n- Better concentration\n- Enhanced memory\n\n### Safety Profile:\n- Adverse Events: Only 5 out of 113 participants (4.4%)\n- Nature: Minor (mild itching, vivid dreams)\n- No serious adverse events reported\n\n### Patient Preference:\n- 90% reported easy to use and convenient\n- 70% preferred patch over sleep medications\n\n---\n\n## Balance & Stability Study (2022) - LIBERTY Patch\n\n### Publication Details:\n- Journal: International Journal of Research in Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation\n- Type: Controlled Comparative Study\n- Authors: John Haddad (American University, Beirut), Baldeep S.

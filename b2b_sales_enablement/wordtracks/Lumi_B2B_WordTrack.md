## 3. OPENING SCRIPTS

### 1. Cold Call
"Good morning, this is [Your Name] from Super Patch. I'm reaching out to practitioners who take a holistic approach to health, including skin wellness. Our Lumi patch uses Vibrotactile Technology to support skin health from the inside out – complementing topical treatments by supporting the body's natural skin vitality. Do you have patients seeking natural beauty support?"

### 2. Email Introduction
**Subject:** Inside-Out Skin Health Support for Your Patients

"Dr. [Name],

Skin health reflects internal wellness. While topical treatments address the surface, true radiance comes from within. Many patients want holistic beauty support that goes beyond creams and procedures.

Our Lumi patch uses Vibrotactile Technology – neural pathway support for skin vitality from the inside out. Drug-free, complement to topical treatments.

Would you be open to discussing how this could enhance your skin wellness offerings?

Best regards,
[Your Name]"

## 4. DISCOVERY QUESTIONS

1. "Do your patients ask for holistic approaches to skin health?"
2. "How do you currently address the inside-out component of skin wellness?"
3. "Are patients frustrated that topical products alone aren't delivering results?"
4. "Would an inside-out support option complement your skin health protocols?"

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION (2-Minute)

**[PROBLEM]**
"Skin health reflects internal wellness – we know this. Yet most beauty approaches focus only on the surface: topical products, procedures, external treatments. Patients often get frustrated when these alone don't deliver the radiance they want. There's a missing piece: supporting skin health from within."

**[SOLUTION]**
"Lumi uses Vibrotactile Technology to support the neural pathways involved in skin vitality. Based on Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research, it provides inside-out support that complements topical treatments. Think of it as optimizing the body's skin renewal processes through neural signaling.

For your practice: a holistic beauty support option, integration with existing treatments, and 25% practitioner margin. Would you like to offer this to your beauty-conscious patients?"

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Skin health is about nutrition, hydration, and topicals."
**Response:** "All important factors – and Lumi complements them. The nervous system plays a role in skin health through circulation, cellular renewal signaling, and stress modulation (which affects skin). Lumi adds neural pathway support to the comprehensive approach you're already providing."

### "How can a patch on the arm affect skin health?"
**Response:** "VTT works systemically through neural signaling, not locally. By activating mechanoreceptors, it influences nervous system functions that affect the whole body, including skin health. It's similar to how stress (a neural phenomenon) affects skin – but in a positive, supportive direction."

### "Beauty patients want visible results fast."
**Response:** "I understand – and Lumi is meant to complement visible treatments, not replace them. What it offers is foundational support that may enhance and extend the results of external treatments. For patients investing in beauty, supporting skin health from within makes their other investments more effective."

### "This seems outside my scope of practice."
**Response:** "Lumi is wellness support, not a beauty treatment. Many practitioners are seeing patients seek holistic approaches to all aspects of health, including skin. If you have patients who connect their overall wellness to how they look and feel, Lumi fits that conversation."

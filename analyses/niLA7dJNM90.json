KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS\n**Framework/Technique Name:** Assumptive Close\n\n**Step-by-step process:**\n1.  **Adopt an \"Assumptive\" Mindset:** Believe that the prospect will eventually buy your product/service, assuming it's a good fit and solves their problem. Your mindset should be \"when,\" not \"if.\"\n2.  **Avoid Passivity:** Do not ask direct \"yes/no\" questions that put all control in the prospect's hands (e.g., \"Will you buy my product?\").\n3.  **Avoid Aggression:** Do not demand an immediate decision or pressure the prospect excessively (e.g., \"You need to make a decision on this right now!\"). This will scare them away.\n4.  **Use Assumptive Language & Questions:** Frame your questions and statements around the *assumption* that the sale will occur, focusing on logistical or preference-based choices. This steers the conversation toward implementation rather than decision-making on the core purchase.\n5.  **Integrate throughout the Sales Process:** Apply this mindset and questioning technique from the very first discovery call through to the demo and final close.\n\n**The psychology/principle behind why it works:**\nThe Assumptive Close works because it shifts the salesperson's mindset from uncertainty (\"if they will buy\") to certainty (\"when they will buy\"). This belief subtly impacts the language and questions used, framing the conversation as if the purchase is already a foregone conclusion. By offering choices about *how* or *when* to proceed, rather than *whether* to proceed, it psychologically moves the prospect past the initial \"buy/don't buy\" decision point and into the \"how/when\" logistics. It avoids giving the prospect an easy \"no\" and instead directs them toward an implied \"yes\" through alternative choices. This puts the salesperson in control of the next steps without being aggressive.\n\n### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS\n\n**Assumptive Discovery/Closing Questions:**\n\n*   \"What day works better for delivery, Monday or Tuesday?\"\n*   \"How many total licenses will you need?\"\n*   \"What day would you like our technical team to begin implementation with your IT manager?\"\n*   \"When would you like to hang out again, Monday or Tuesday of next week?\" (Personal example)\n\n**Assumptive Statements/Framing:**\n\n*   \"When you sign the order, this is what the implementation process will look like.\"\n*   \"Let's meet next Tuesday to review the pricing.\"\n\n**Passive Questions to Avoid:**\n\n*   \"Will you buy my product?\"\n*   \"Would you like to buy my product or service?\"\n*   \"Can we meet next Tuesday?\"\n\n**Aggressive Statements to Avoid:**\n\n*   \"You need to make a decision on this right now.\"\n\n### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING\nThe video **does not explicitly discuss objection handling** in terms of specific common objections and recommended responses. Instead, the focus is on adopting the assumptive close technique to guide the conversation and prevent \"no\" answers or objections related to the core purchase decision by assuming the sale will occur. The implicit goal is to preempt objections by confidently moving toward the next steps.\n\n### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n1.  **\"When, Not If\" Mindset:** Approach every sales interaction with the belief that the prospect *will* buy if your product is a good fit. This fundamental assumption will naturally guide your language and questions.\n2.  **Avoid Extremes (Passive/Aggressive):** Don't be so passive that you give all control to the prospect (e.g., asking \"Will you buy?\"), and don't be so aggressive that you scare them away (e.g., demanding an immediate decision).\n3.  **Offer Assumptive Choices:** Instead of asking *if* they want to buy or take the next step, ask *when* or *how* they want to proceed by offering specific options (e.g., \"Which day works better, A or B?\").\n4.  **Integrate Assumptive Language Early:** Start using assumptive questions and statements from the very first discovery call, not just at the end when you're trying to close. This sets the tone for a forward-moving conversation.\n5.  **Control the Narrative:** The assumptive close allows you to maintain control of the sales process by guiding the prospect toward logistical decisions rather than open-ended purchase decisions, fostering a sense of progress.\n\n### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION\n\nApplying the Assumptive Close to selling Super Patch wellness products:\n\n1.  **Initial Discovery/Consultation:**\n    *   Instead of: \"Are you interested in trying a Super Patch for your pain?\"\n    *   Use: **\"Based on what you've shared about your discomfort, when would be the best day next week for you to start feeling relief with the Super Patch, Monday or Tuesday?\"** (Assumes they'll start, offers a choice of start date.)\n    *   Instead of: \"Do you want to know more about how these patches work?\"\n    *   Use: **\"When we dive into the science behind the Super Patch technology, which aspect would you like to understand first: how it helps with pain, or how it improves sleep?\"** (Assumes they want to learn, guides the discussion.)\n\n2.  **Product Recommendation/Pricing:**\n    *   Instead of: \"Would you like to purchase a pack of these patches?\"\n    *   Use: **\"Considering your needs, which pack size will work best for you to get started \u2013 the 30-day supply or the 90-day supply for sustained results?\"** (Assumes they're buying, offers choice of quantity/duration.)\n    *   Instead of: \"Can I send you the pricing information?\"\n    *   Use: **\"I can email you the link to complete your order, or would you prefer I walk you through the checkout process now?\"** (Assumes they're ready to order, offers choice of method.)\n\n3.  **Onboarding/Follow-up (after initial purchase):**\n    *   Instead of: \"Do you think you'll apply the patch every day?\"\n    *   Use: **\"Now that you have your Super Patch, what time of day will you typically apply it for maximum benefit \u2013 first thing in the morning, or right before bed?\"** (Assumes daily use, helps establish routine.)\n    *   Instead of: \"Let me know if you have any questions about using the patches.\"\n    *   Use: **\"After you've had a chance to try the patches for a few days, when would you like to reconnect to discuss your experience and ensure you're getting the most out of them \u2013 Thursday afternoon or Friday morning?\"** (Assumes positive experience, schedules proactive follow-up.)\n\n4.  **Team Building/Recruitment (for direct sales):**\n    *   Instead of: \"Would you be interested in learning about becoming a Super Patch distributor?\"\n    *   Use: **\"When you decide to join our Super Patch team, which onboarding session would you like to attend \u2013 the one on Tuesday or the one on Saturday?\"** (Assumes they'll join, offers choice of training time.)\n    *   Instead of: \"Can I share some information about our compensation plan?\"\n    *   Use: **\"Once you see how rewarding it is to share Super Patch, how quickly do you envision reaching your first commission goal \u2013 within 30 days or 60 days?\"** (Assumes success, frames future goals.)"

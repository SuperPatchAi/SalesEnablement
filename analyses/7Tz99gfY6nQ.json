MAIN TOPIC & TECHNIQUE\nThe primary sales concept/technique being taught is **Influence and Persuasion through Applied Behavioral Neuroscience and Congruent Communication**. The core idea is that \"Selling is change, it's a behavior change,\" and by understanding how the human brain processes information and emotions, salespeople can become significantly more influential.\n\n### 2. KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS\n\n**A. Understanding the Brain as a Foundation**\n*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Brain-Centric Persuasion\n*   **Step-by-step process:** Not a direct step-by-step, but a foundational principle.\n*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:** Rene states, \"If you understand how the brain works, life becomes just exponentially easier.\" The underlying principle is that human behavior, including buying decisions, is driven by the brain's processes, subconscious cues, and the innate desire to avoid resistance to change. By understanding these mechanisms, a salesperson can tailor their approach to be more effective.\n\n**B. Non-Verbal Communication (Tone & Body Language)**\n*   **Framework/Technique Name:** The 93% Non-Verbal Impact Rule\n*   **Step-by-step process:**\n    1.  **Be Aware of Your Internal State:** Recognize your own feelings (sad, confident, confused, excited).\n    2.  **Align Posture & Tone:** Ensure your physical posture (even if unseen on a phone call) and vocal tone are congruent with the message you intend to convey.\n    3.  **Recognize Prospect's Non-Verbals:** Pay attention to their non-verbal cues (e.g., tone, hesitation) as they reveal their underlying meaning and emotional state.\n*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:** \"When you combine TONE and BODY, you have 93% of the impact you make on people. It has nothing to do with the words.\" The brain constantly seeks congruency. Incongruence between what you say and how you say it (or how you physically appear) triggers a \"threat\" response in the amygdala, leading to distrust and resistance. Conversely, congruency builds trust and makes your message more impactful. Rene states, \"Your posture on that phone call, even though they can't see it, is 100% affecting the TONE of your VOICE.\"\n\n**C. Congruency and Owning the Frame**\n*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Congruent Framing (or Owning the Frame)\n*   **Step-by-step process:**\n    1.  **Identify Incongruence:** Recognize when your words or actions might send mixed signals (e.g., shaking hands while saying \"I'm excited\" if your words suggest the opposite).\n    2.  **Pre-Frame or Reframe:** Proactively address potential incongruencies or explain the *meaning* behind your non-verbals.\n    3.  **Align Internal & External:** Ensure your internal belief and emotional state align with your external expression.\n*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:** \"Your brain is DESIGNED to work in a congruent fashion.\" When the brain detects incongruence, it creates distrust. By actively explaining the meaning behind your state (e.g., \"I'm shaking because this means a lot to me\"), you create congruency and maintain trust. Jeremy highlights that most objections arise from a lack of congruency and understanding early in the conversation.\n\n**D. Objection Prevention and Pivoting**\n*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Objection Pre-emption (or Result-Based Framing)\n*   **Step-by-step process:**\n    1.  **Shift Focus from Price/Cost:** Immediately pivot away from price or cost-based thinking.\n    2.  **Focus on End Result/Value:** Reframe the conversation to highlight the ultimate benefits and desired outcomes for the prospect.\n    3.  **Comparative Frame:** Create a comparative frame that forces the prospect to choose between the desired result and the cost, guiding them towards the result.\n*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:** Prospects are often focused on price or cost (the \"current state\"). Salespeople need to shift their thinking to the \"objective state\" (the desired outcome or result). By immediately framing the conversation around results, you prevent objections related to price from becoming central. Jeremy emphasizes, \"I always think I'm the one causing the objections, not the prospect.\"\n\n**E. The Tie-down (for Influence)**\n*   **Framework/Technique Name:** The Tie-down Technique\n*   **Step-by-step process:**\n    1.  **Share a Relevant Story/Message:** Present information (e.g., a personal story, testimonial, or product benefit).\n    2.  **Ask \"What Does This Mean To You?\":** Conclude the story or message by asking the prospect directly about the personal significance of what was shared.\n*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:** Influence is not simply about moving someone emotionally, but about getting them to act. The tie-down connects the emotional movement to personal relevance, making the decision to act more logical and compelling. It ensures the prospect internalizes the meaning for *themselves*. Rene defines it as answering \"what does this mean to you?\" after a story.\n\n**F. Confidence as a Result**\n*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Earned Confidence\n*   **Step-by-step process:** Not a direct step-by-step, but an insight into developing confidence.\n*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:** \"Confidence is a reward given to you for showing the courage to try it anyways even without it.\" True confidence in sales is not a prerequisite but a result of acquiring skills, taking action, and achieving results. Jeremy highlights that a salesperson's \"confidence level will always go down to where your current skill level is.\"\n\n### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS\n\n*   **Overarching Principle:**\n    *   \"Selling is change, it's a behavior change.\" (Rene Rodriguez)\n    *   \"If you understand how the brain works, life becomes just exponentially easier.\" (Rene Rodriguez)\n\n*   **Introduction/Credibility Building:**\n    *   \"He's considered by a lot more than many as one of the LEADING AUTHORITIES on LEADERSHIP & INFLUENCE. Ren\u00e9 Rodriguez is a best-selling author, KEY-NOTE speaker, LEADERSHIP advisor, TRANSFORMATIONAL speaker, and COACH.\" (Jeremy Miner, introducing Rene)\n    *   \"I'll tell you a little bit about my story because my background relates to what is necessary if you want to take your sales ability to a level most people don't believe they could ever dream about.\" (Jeremy Miner, on framing his story)\n\n*   **Non-Verbal Impact:**\n    *   \"When you combine TONE and BODY, you have 93% of the impact you make on people. It has nothing to do with the words.\" (Rene Rodriguez)\n    *   \"If you're feeling SAD or let's say you're not feeling confident, your POSTURE (on that phone call) even though they can't see it... is 100% affecting the TONE of your VOICE.\" (Rene Rodriguez)\n\n*   **Congruency:**\n    *   \"Try having a CONFUSED TONE with a STRAIGHT FACE.\" (Jeremy Miner, demonstrating incongruence)\n    *   \"'Cause your brain is DESIGNED to work in a congruent fashion.\" (Rene Rodriguez)\n    *   **(Regarding micro-expressions/nervousness):** \"Can you get me to STOP DOING THAT?\" (Salesperson to Rene) - *Rene's suggested responses:* \"Do you BELIEVE in what you're SAYING THERE?\" or \"How 'bout we talk about something you BELIEVE in?\" (Rene Rodriguez)\n\n*   **Listening for Meaning:**\n    *   \"It's really about the MEANING that people associate to it.\" (Rene Rodriguez)\n    *   \"Listen to what the prospect MEANS, not just what they SAY.\" (Jeremy Miner)\n\n*   **Questioning & Pacing:**\n    *   **(To gain clarity on an objection):** \"What did you mean when you said you're having issues with like, the debt?\" (Jeremy Miner, using a confused tone to draw out more information).\n    *   **(To emphasize a point in a question):** \"Okay, why's THIS so important to you NOW though?\" (Jeremy Miner, using verbal pauses and emphasizing \"NOW\").\n\n*   **Objection Prevention/Reframing (Price):**\n    *   **(When a prospect says \"Can you give us a cheaper price?\"):** \"Is PRICE the most important thing to you or actually getting X-Y-Z RESULT?\" (Jeremy Miner)\n\n*   **Tie-down:**\n    *   **(After sharing a story about overcoming being called 'stupid'):** \"What does THAT mean to you?\" (Rene Rodriguez)\n\n*   **Motivation & Action:**\n    *   \"Confidence is a reward given to you for showing the courage to try it anyways even without it.\" (Rene Rodriguez)\n    *   \"You want to gain more confidence in sales, you gotta gain more skill level... Because your confidence level will always go down to where your current skill level is.\" (Jeremy Miner)\n\n### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING\n\n*   **Common Objection Mentioned:** \"It's too expensive\" or \"Can you give us a cheaper price?\"\n*   **Recommended Response (Exact Wording if Provided):** \"Is PRICE the most important thing to you or actually getting X-Y-Z RESULT?\" (Jeremy Miner)\n*   **The Reframe or Psychology Behind Each Response:** This reframes the conversation from cost (current state) to value and desired outcome (objective state). It forces the prospect to articulate what is truly important to them, making it harder to justify a decision based solely on price if the result is valuable. By focusing on the result, the salesperson can then justify the cost as an investment in that desired outcome.\n\n### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n1.  **Master Non-Verbal Communication:** 93% of your impact is in your tone and body language. Ensure congruency between your internal state, your words, and your non-verbals to build trust and influence.\n2.  **Frame for Influence:** Actively control the narrative through storytelling, pre-framing, and timely tie-downs. Guide the prospect's brain to the desired interpretation and emotional connection.\n3.  **Prevent Objections by Focusing on Results:** Don't just handle objections; anticipate and prevent them by immediately shifting the conversation from price/cost to the ultimate benefits and outcomes the prospect seeks.\n4.  **Earn Confidence Through Skill and Action:** Confidence in sales is not innate; it's developed by continuously improving your skills and consistently putting in the effort, even when unsure. Do the work, and confidence will follow.\n5.  **Listen for Meaning, Not Just Words:** Pay close attention to a prospect's tone and underlying intent. Understand *why* they are saying what they are saying to respond effectively and build rapport.\n\n### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION\n\nThese techniques can be powerfully applied to selling Super Patch wellness products:\n\n*   **Framing the Problem & Solution:**\n    *   **Initial Approach:** Instead of immediately listing patch features, frame the common struggle. \"Many people experience daily aches, poor sleep, or low energy that prevent them from enjoying life fully. What does *that* mean for you, not being able to [desired activity]?\"\n    *   **Storytelling for Pain/Energy/Sleep:** Share a personal or customer story. \"I had a client, Sarah, who suffered from chronic knee pain. She tried everything, but nothing worked until she tried the Super Patch. Within days, she was walking her dog again without wincing. What would it *mean to you* to wake up pain-free and get back to your favorite activities?\" (Use enthusiastic tone, open body language).\n    *   **Pre-framing skepticism:** Acknowledge the novelty. \"I know it sounds almost too good to be true, a patch that helps with sleep/pain/energy. It's a new concept for many people, which is why I want to briefly explain the science so you understand *how* it works.\" (Use a warm, reassuring tone).\n\n*   **Leveraging Tonality and Body Language:**\n    *   **During discovery calls (phone or video):** Maintain an open posture even if on the phone to positively influence your tone. If the prospect expresses doubt, match their initial tone with empathy (e.g., slightly lower, slower voice) then shift to a more confident, slightly higher tone when offering the solution.\n    *   **Demonstrating the patch:** When demonstrating the patch placement, use clear, precise hand gestures to show confidence and expertise. A slightly leaning-in posture can convey engagement and interest.\n\n*   **Objection Prevention (Cost/Skepticism):**\n    *   **Cost Reframe:** If a prospect asks about price, pivot to the long-term value and immediate benefits. \"I understand cost is a consideration. What's more important to you: saving a few dollars now, or experiencing consistent, quality sleep/pain relief/energy that allows you to be fully present and active every single day?\" (Hold up two fingers to emphasize the choice, then open hands to invite discussion).\n    *   **Skepticism Pre-emption (Congruency):** If you notice hesitation, *own* it. \"I can sense some skepticism, and that's completely normal for something so innovative. I felt the same way until I saw the results myself. My passion for these patches comes from seeing them genuinely transform lives, not just from the sale itself.\" (Show vulnerability then confidence, aligning your words with genuine emotion).\n\n*   **The Tie-down for Action:**\n    *   **After explaining technology:** \"Considering how these patches work to naturally stimulate your body's own abilities, what impact could that technology have on your overall well-being?\"\n    *   **After a clear benefit statement:** \"If you could regain [lost ability, e.g., ability to garden, play with grandkids] thanks to consistent pain relief, what would *that* mean for your daily life?\" (This personalizes the benefit and prompts them to visualize the positive change).\n\n*   **Building Your Own Confidence (as a Super Patch Seller):**\n    *   **Skill-based Confidence:** Dedicate time to learning the science behind Super Patch technology (Vibrotactile Technology, neuro-stimuli), understanding the different patches and their specific benefits, and practicing how to explain them simply.\n    *   **Practice \"Hero's Journey\" Stories:** Develop and rehearse personal stories of overcoming challenges (perhaps related to health, energy, or sleep) and how Super Patch was the \"mentor\" or \"solution\" in your journey. Ensure these stories have a clear tie-down to the prospect's potential journey.\n    *   **Embrace Initial Discomfort:** Accept that initial sales conversations can be daunting. See each interaction as a chance to refine your skills and earn confidence, rather than just focusing on the outcome."

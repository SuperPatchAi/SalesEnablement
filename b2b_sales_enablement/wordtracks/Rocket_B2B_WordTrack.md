## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION SCRIPT (2-Minute)

**(Problem-Agitate-Solve-Evidence Framework)**

**(PROBLEM)**

"Men's vitality concerns are increasingly common across all ages – energy decline, confidence issues, and wellness challenges that affect quality of life. But the pharmaceutical options come with significant concerns.

ED medications carry cardiovascular risks. Testosterone therapy has prostate implications. And both require prescriptions and ongoing medical oversight."

**(AGITATE)**

"This leaves many men suffering in silence or taking risks they shouldn't. Men who have heart conditions can't use common medications. Men concerned about prostate health avoid testosterone. And many simply don't want pharmaceutical intervention for something they see as a wellness issue.

Meanwhile, stress, aging, and lifestyle factors continue to affect vitality, and men need support."

**(SOLVE)**

"That's why Rocket is such a valuable option. It supports men's energy and vitality through Vibrotactile Technology – activating neural pathways naturally without pharmaceuticals.

There's nothing going into the body, no forced blood flow, no hormonal manipulation. The specialized ridge patterns activate pathways supporting natural vitality – working with the body's capacity rather than forcing function."

**(EVIDENCE)**

"The science foundation is mechanoreceptor research that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine. The nervous system plays a significant role in vitality and energy – VTT supports those pathways.

For your male patients, this means vitality support without pharmaceutical concerns. For your practice, it means having an option for men who want help but don't want or can't use medications.

Would you like to integrate Rocket into your men's health protocols?"

***

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### 1. "Men's health issues require proper diagnosis first."

**Response:** "I completely agree – medical evaluation is important. Rocket isn't meant to treat diagnosed conditions.

It's for men seeking wellness support – vitality enhancement for those without pathology, or support alongside medical treatment. Would that application be relevant for your practice?"

### 2. "How can a patch affect men's vitality?"

**Response:** "Good question. The mechanism is neural pathway activation through mechanoreceptors.

The nervous system plays a significant role in energy and vitality. VTT activates supportive pathways naturally – it's working with the body's systems rather than forcing pharmaceutical effects. Would understanding the mechanism help?"

### 3. "Patients expect immediate, powerful effects like medications."

**Response:** "Those expectations are set by pharmaceuticals that carry significant risks. Rocket provides supportive wellness, not forced function.

Positioning it as 'enhancing your natural vitality' sets appropriate expectations for sustainable, safe support. How do you typically frame men's health conversations?"

### 4. "What about men with actual ED or low testosterone?"

**Response:** "Those conditions may need medical treatment – that's your clinical judgment. Rocket isn't replacing that.

For men with declining vitality who don't have pathological diagnosis, or as complementary support alongside treatment, Rocket provides drug-free assistance. Would that population be relevant?"

### 5. "I'm not comfortable making claims about men's health."

**Response:** "I appreciate that caution. We position Rocket as vitality and energy support, not treatment for any condition.

It's wellness enhancement for men seeking natural support. The claims are about neural pathway support for energy, not therapeutic outcomes. Does that positioning feel appropriate?"

### 6. "Men might use this to avoid proper medical evaluation."

**Response:** "That's an important concern. Rocket should be recommended within appropriate clinical context.

You can recommend it for men who've been evaluated and don't have pathology, or as support alongside treatment you're providing. It doesn't replace evaluation. Does that framing work?"

### 7. "How is this different from supplements for men?"

**Response:** "Supplements work through nutritional pathways and have variable efficacy and absorption. Rocket works through neural pathway activation – a completely different mechanism.

It's not competing with supplements – it's providing support through a different system. Men can use both if appropriate. Would that distinction be valuable?"

### 8. "Is there research specifically on men's vitality?"

**Response:** "The underlying mechanism – VTT and neural pathways – is based on Nobel Prize-winning science.

For your practice, trialing Rocket with appropriate male patients and assessing their experience would provide direct evidence. Would a pilot approach work?"

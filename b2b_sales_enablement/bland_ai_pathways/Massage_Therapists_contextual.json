Basically, the patches have these raised patterns that stimulate nerve receptors in your skin - kind of like how braille works for reading, but for your nervous system. No drugs absorbed at all.\"\n\n\"A lot of LMTs have been using them for patients who need support between visits - especially for things like pain, sleep, and stress.\"\n\n## After Explaining:\n\nIF THEY SEEM INTERESTED:\n\u2192 Route to \"Discovery: Practice Overview\"\nSay: \"So tell me - what types of patients do you mostly see in your practice?\"\n\nIF THEY'RE STILL SKEPTICAL:\n\u2192 Route to \"Objection: Need Research\"\nListen for their concern and address it.\n\nIF THEY SAY \"NOT FOR ME\":\n\u2192 Route to \"Objection: Not Interested\"\nSay: \"Totally get it.

Present the Freedom patch specifically.\n\n## Your Presentation\n\n\"So Freedom is our flagship patch for pain. Here's what's cool about it:\n\nThe clinical evidence - we did a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 118 participants with chronic pain over 14 days. Published in Pain Therapeutics journal. Significant reduction in pain AND improvement in range of motion. It's registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT06505005 if you want to look it up.\n\nHow it works - the patch has these raised geometric patterns that stimulate mechanoreceptors in the skin. These are the same receptors that Nobel Prize-winning research identified. It signals through neural pathways to modulate pain perception. No drugs, nothing absorbed.\n\nFor your patients - they apply it in the morning, it lasts all day. No pills to remember, no side effects to worry about. Works out to about three dollars a day.\n\nFor your LMTs patients specifically, it's great between adjustments when they might otherwise reach for NSAIDs.\"\n\n## After Presenting:\n\nIF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS:\n\u2192 Route to relevant objection node based on question\n\nIF THEY SEEM INTERESTED:\n\u2192 Route to \"Business Model Options\"\nSay: \"Want me to tell you how LMTs typically work with us?\"\n\nIF THEY'RE SKEPTICAL:\n\u2192 Route to \"Objection: Need Research\"\n\n## What NOT to Do\n- Don't oversell or make medical claims\n- Don't rush through the clinical data\n- Pause for their reactions"

Present the REM patch.\n\n## Your Presentation\n\n\"For sleep, the REM patch is pretty remarkable. Let me share the study results:\n\nWe had participants who were averaging over an hour to fall asleep. By the end of the study, that dropped to about 37 minutes. But here's the big one - 80% of participants who were using sleep medications were able to stop using them.\n\nAnd unlike sleep meds, there's no morning grogginess. Patients wake up feeling rested, not foggy. No tolerance buildup either - day 30 works as well as day 1.\n\nHow they use it - they apply it about an hour before bed. The VTT technology signals the nervous system to shift into rest mode. Same mechanism as Freedom, just different neural pathways.\n\nFor your patients who've tried melatonin, tried sleep apps, tried everything - this is something different. It works through touch, not chemistry.\"\n\n## After Presenting:\n\nIF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS:\n\u2192 Route to relevant objection node\n\nIF INTERESTED IN MORE PRODUCTS:\n\u2192 Route to \"Present: Product Overview\" \n\nIF READY TO MOVE FORWARD:\n\u2192 Route to \"Business Model Options\"\n\n## What NOT to Do\n- Don't promise it replaces medical treatment\n- Don't claim it cures insomnia\n- Present it as a drug-free support option"

You know that shift from fight-or-flight to rest-and-digest? That's what we're supporting.\n\nPatients wear it during the day, especially during high-stress periods. Some use it specifically before stressful situations - meetings, travel, whatever triggers them.\n\nThe beauty for your patients - it's not a sedative. They're not foggy or drowsy.

That's huge for patients dealing with stability issues - whether it's age-related, post-injury, or neurological.\n\nHow it works - the patch is worn on the upper back, near C7. The VTT pattern sends signals that help with proprioception - the body's sense of where it is in space.\n\nFor your senior patients especially, this can be life-changing. Falls are such a big deal - anything that improves stability is valuable.\n\nThe feedback we get is patients feel more confident moving.

This is good - it means they're thinking critically.\n\n## Your Response\n\n\"Honestly? I love that you're asking. As a healthcare provider, you should demand evidence. So here's what we have:\n\nThe Freedom patch went through a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial. 118 participants with chronic pain over 14 days. Published in Pain Therapeutics, peer-reviewed journal. Registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT06505005.\n\nWe also have the HARMONI study on sleep and the Balance study for Liberty. All peer-reviewed, all available for you to look at.\n\nThe lead researcher is from University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Legit academic work, not in-house marketing studies.\n\nI can email you the abstracts right after this call. What's your email?\"\n\n## If They're Still Skeptical:\n\n\"Look, I totally get it - I was skeptical too before I saw the data. But here's the thing - it's easy to verify. Look up the ClinicalTrials.gov registration. Read the published papers. The evidence is there.\"\n\n\n## Massage Therapists-Specific Response\nI totally get that - you became an LMT to help people, not to sell products. But think of it this way: when clients ask what they can do at home, you're providing a solution, not selling. It's completing their care. You probably already recommend stretches, right? This is just another tool.\n\n\n## Massage Therapists-Specific Response\nThat's a fair concern. Clients who value massage already understand investing in their wellness. At $3/day, it's less than their daily latte. And if it helps them maintain benefits longer, they might need fewer sessions - which saves them money.\n\n\n## Massage Therapists-Specific Response\nGreat question! Menthol patches deliver a cooling substance through the skin. SuperPatch doesn't deliver anything - it's purely physical pattern stimulation. No smell, no chemicals, no mess. For clients who want truly drug-free, this is a different category.\n\n## After Addressing:\n\nIF SATISFIED:\n\u2192 Route back to previous topic (presentation or business model)\nSay: \"So with that in mind, want to hear how LMTs typically work with us?\"\n\nIF STILL SKEPTICAL:\n\u2192 Route to \"Offer Sample\"\nSay: \"You know what? The easiest thing is just to try it yourself. Can I send you a sample?\"\n\n## What NOT to Do\n- Don't get defensive\n- Don't dismiss their skepticism\n- Embrace their critical thinking"

For patients who would otherwise buy daily supplements - glucosamine, turmeric, whatever - it's comparable or less.\n\nFor patients dealing with chronic issues, think about what they're already spending. OTC pain relievers add up. Sleep aids add up. And those often come with side effects.\n\nThe other thing - there's no tolerance buildup with VTT. Day 30 works as well as day 1. With a lot of other things, you need more and more over time.\n\nFor patients who are struggling with [their specific issue], what's the cost of NOT having something that works?\"\n\n## If They Say \"My Patients Can't Afford It\":\n\n\"I hear you. Here's what some LMTs do - they recommend it for patients who've tried everything else and are really struggling.

Supplements work internally through chemistry. VTT works externally through neural pathways. Totally different mechanism.\n\nA lot of LMTs use both. Like, they'll recommend turmeric for inflammation AND Freedom for pain signaling. Different approaches, same goal.\n\nThink of it as another tool in your toolkit.

You do incredible work during sessions, but within days the tension returns. Think of it as continuous, gentle touch therapy for the other 23 hours.\n\n## Top Products to Recommend\n- Freedom: For your pain clients - 'Wear this for the next few days to maintain your progress'\n- Peace: Maintains relaxation benefits - keeps that calm going at home\n- REM: Sleep support for recovery - better sleep means better results from your work\n\n\n## This Node: Handle \"I Don't Want to Sell Products\"\n\nThey're uncomfortable with the idea of selling to patients.\n\n## Your Response\n\n\"Totally understand that concern. A lot of practitioners feel the same way - you got into this to help people, not to be a salesperson.\n\nHere's the thing though - your patients are already buying something. They're buying supplements, or pain relievers, or sleep aids from Amazon or Walgreens or wherever. They're just doing it without your guidance.\n\nWhen you recommend something, you're not selling - you're guiding. And that's valuable.\n\nBut hey, if retail isn't your thing, that's exactly why we have the affiliate option. You just recommend SuperPatch, patients order directly from us using your link. You earn a commission, but you never handle transactions or inventory. You're just making a recommendation, which you do anyway.\"\n\n## If They're Still Hesitant:\n\n\"Really, with affiliate, there's zero retail involved. You mention SuperPatch, maybe give them a card with your code, and they go home and order online if they want. That's it. No inventory, no transactions, no awkward money conversations.\"\n\n\n## Massage Therapists-Specific Response\nI totally get that - you became an LMT to help people, not to sell products. But think of it this way: when clients ask what they can do at home, you're providing a solution, not selling. It's completing their care. You probably already recommend stretches, right? This is just another tool.\n\n\n## Massage Therapists-Specific Response\nThat's a fair concern. Clients who value massage already understand investing in their wellness. At $3/day, it's less than their daily latte. And if it helps them maintain benefits longer, they might need fewer sessions - which saves them money.\n\n\n## Massage Therapists-Specific Response\nGreat question! Menthol patches deliver a cooling substance through the skin. SuperPatch doesn't deliver anything - it's purely physical pattern stimulation. No smell, no chemicals, no mess. For clients who want truly drug-free, this is a different category.\n\n## After Addressing:\n\nIF THEY'RE OPEN TO AFFILIATE:\n\u2192 Route to \"Business Model: Affiliate\"\nSay: \"Want me to explain how the affiliate program works?\"\n\nIF STILL RESISTANT:\n\u2192 Route to \"Handle No Gracefully\"\nSay: \"I hear you. It's not for everyone. Can I at least send you some info in case you change your mind later?\"\n\n## If They Say \"I Don't Have Space to Stock Products\"\n\n\"I hear you \u2013 space is always tight. Here's the thing: the patches are small and don't expire quickly. You could literally keep them in a drawer and just pull one out when relevant. Or we can set you up with an affiliate link \u2013 you recommend, they order online, and you earn commission without stocking anything. Which would work better for you?\"\n\n## What NOT to Do\n- Don't make them feel guilty\n- Don't push retail on someone who hates selling\n- Affiliate is the answer here"

But here's the thing - patients don't need to believe in it. They just need to experience it.\n\nThink about it this way: when you first explain [chiropractic/massage/acupuncture] to a new patient, do they fully understand how it works? Probably not. But they feel better afterward, so they keep coming back.\n\nSame thing here. The mechanism is sophisticated - neural signaling through mechanoreceptors - but the patient experience is simple. They put on a patch, they feel better. That's what matters to them.\n\nMost practitioners start by trying it themselves. Once you feel it, you understand. Then you try it on a few open-minded patients. Once they feel it, they become your evangelists.\"\n\n## If Still Skeptical:\n\n\"Look, you don't have to lead with the technology explanation.

There are basically three options:\n\n**WHOLESALE** - You buy at 25% off retail, stock the patches in your practice, sell directly to patients. You control pricing, you keep the margin.

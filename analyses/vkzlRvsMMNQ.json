MAIN TOPIC & TECHNIQUE\n\nThe primary sales concept/technique being taught is **\"Real Rapport vs. Fake Rapport.\"** The core idea is to immediately establish oneself as an expert and trusted authority in the prospect's mind, rather than being perceived as \"just another salesperson\" through generic, predictable conversational openings.\n\n### 2. KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS\n\n**A. Fake Rapport**\n\n*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Fake Rapport\n*   **Step-by-step process:** Salespeople often start conversations with generic, predictable questions.\n    1.  \"How's your day going?\"\n    2.  \"How are you doing today?\"\n    3.  \"How's the weather there in [City Name]?\"\n    4.  \"Did you see the game last night?\"\n*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works (or doesn't work):**\n    *   **Prospect interprets as:** \"I'm just trying to set you to 'like' me so I can sell you my product/service/thing.\"\n    *   This lowers the salesperson's status in the prospect's brain because these are the same predictable questions every salesperson has ever asked them. Society views salespeople at a lower status, so asking these questions reinforces that lower status, making the prospect automatically put up their guard.\n\n**B. Real Rapport**\n\n*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Real Rapport\n*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:**\n    *   **Definition:** \"Getting prospect into 'Results' based thinking from 1st words out of mouth.\"\n    *   **Outcome:** \"View you more as an Expert, Trusted Authority vs. just another salesperson trying to sell me something.\"\n    *   **Principle:** This approach avoids triggering sales resistance by immediately focusing on the prospect's desired outcomes and positioning the salesperson as a knowledgeable problem-solver. It raises the salesperson's status in the prospect's mind.\n\n*   **Step-by-step process for Building Real Rapport (Generic Example - Inbound Lead via Zoom/Virtual Sales):**\n    1.  **Initial Tech Check (Zoom/Virtual):** Start with a simple, practical question.\n        *   *Script:* \"Can you hear me...? Can you see me?\" (If video is off, gently nudge: \"Is your video maybe broken? I can't see you.\")\n    2.  **Transition & Pre-frame (Looking at notes - slow tone):** After confirming audio/video, look down at notes and slow your tone.\n        *   *Script:* \"Alright (look down at notes), it looks like you booked on the calendar about looking at 'possible' help with [BLANK] so that you can [REPEAT BACK END RESULT], right?\"\n        *   **Psychology:**\n            *   **Looking down at notes:** Implies preparation and professionalism, suggesting this isn't a generic call.\n            *   **Slow tone:** Gives the prospect time to process the information and internalize it. Avoids sounding rushed or aggressive.\n            *   **\"Possible\"**: Neutralizes sales pressure by indicating flexibility and not assuming they're ready to buy immediately. It acknowledges their exploratory phase.\n            *   **Repeating back \"End Result\"**: Immediately shifts the focus to their desired outcome, making the salesperson seem focused on their needs and an expert in achieving those results.\n            *   **\"Right?\"**: Seeks agreement and gets an early \"yes,\" building micro-commitments.\n    3.  **Specific Industry Applications (Examples):**\n\n        *   **Business Consulting (B2B):**\n            *   *Script:* \"Looks like you booked on the calendar about looking at 'possible' help with **putting in better systems** so you can **scale the business**, right?\"\n            *   *End Result:* Scaling the business.\n\n        *   **Solar (Residential - Inbound):**\n            *   *Script:* \"Looks like you booked on the calendar about looking at 'possible' ways to **lower your bill and lock in your rate**, right?\"\n            *   *End Result:* Lower bill and locked-in rate.\n\n        *   **Life Insurance (Outbound - New Lead - e.g., Facebook Ad):**\n            *   *Script:* \"Hey [Prospect Name], it\u2019s J. Miner from XYZ. It looks like you responded to an ad on FB a few hours ago about looking at 'maybe' some different options for **financial protection for the family when something happens to you**, right?\"\n            *   *End Result:* Financial protection for the family.\n            *   **Note on \"maybe\"**: Similar to \"possible,\" it neutralizes pressure.\n\n        *   **Life Insurance (Outbound - Mail Card - aged/cold lead):**\n            *   *Script:* \"Hey [Prospect Name], this is **just** [Your Name]. I **just** had a second to get back to you. I\u2019m licensed with the state and received the request you put in about 'possibly' looking at the **different coverage options**... Were you looking at anything specific or **just wanting to look at all the different options**...?\"\n            *   *End Result:* Looking at all the different options (or finding a specific one).\n            *   **Psychology of \"just\"**: In this specific context (calling an aged/cold lead likely contacted by many others), \"just\" implies a casual, non-threatening approach, disarming the prospect and making them feel less like they're being sold to by an aggressive salesperson. It lowers their guard.\n\n        *   **Marketing Agency (Inbound):**\n            *   *Script:* \"Ok it looks you booked on the calendar about looking at **setting a higher quality lead** to help **scale the business**, right?\"\n            *   *End Result:* Scaling the business (via higher quality leads).\n\n        *   **HVAC (At-the-Home Appointment):**\n            *   *Script:* \"Ok it looks like according to my notes one of our technicians Ryan was out here recently and you scheduled about looking at 'possibly' **upgrading your heating/cooling system** to get your **air circulating better in the upstairs area**, right?\"\n            *   *End Result:* Better air circulation in the upstairs area.\n\n### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS\n\n*(Note: These are extracted from the frameworks above, as the speaker provides them within the context of the technique.)*\n\n*   **Opening Lines (General for Virtual/Zoom calls):**\n    *   \"Can you hear me...? Can you see me?\"\n    *   (If video is off): \"Is your video maybe broken? I can't see you.\"\n    *   (When they ask \"How are you doing?\"): \"Ah, you know, just hanging out, being the boring guy. What about you? What are you doing over there, you getting into trouble in your neck of the woods?\" (Playful tone)\n\n*   **Transition to Real Rapport (Generic):**\n    *   \"Alright (look down at notes), it looks like you booked on the calendar about looking at 'possible' help with [BLANK] so that you can [REPEAT BACK END RESULT], right?\"\n\n*   **Specific Industry Examples (as provided in section 2):**\n    *   **Business Consulting:** \"Looks like you booked on the calendar about looking at 'possible' help with **putting in better systems** so you can **scale the business**, right?\"\n    *   **Solar:** \"Looks like you booked on the calendar about looking at 'possible' ways to **lower your bill and lock in your rate**, right?\"\n    *   **Life Insurance (New Lead):** \"Hey [Prospect Name], it\u2019s J. Miner from XYZ. It looks like you responded to an ad on FB a few hours ago about looking at 'maybe' some different options for **financial protection for the family when something happens to you**, right?\"\n    *   **Life Insurance (Mail Card):** \"Hey [Prospect Name], this is **just** [Your Name]. I **just** had a second to get back to you. I\u2019m licensed with the state and received the request you put in about 'possibly' looking at the **different coverage options**... Were you looking at anything specific or **just wanting to look at all the different options**...?\"\n    *   **Marketing Agency:** \"Ok it looks you booked on the calendar about looking at **setting a higher quality lead** to help **scale the business**, right?\"\n    *   **HVAC:** \"Ok it looks like according to my notes one of our technicians Ryan was out here recently and you scheduled about looking at 'possibly' **upgrading your heating/cooling system** to get your **air circulating better in the upstairs area**, right?\"\n\n### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING\n\n*   **Common objection mentioned:** Prospects (especially A-type personalities, or aged leads) might say, \"Well, I'm not ready to do anything. I'm just kind of seeing what my options are,\" or \"I'm just looking around.\"\n*   **Recommended response (implied within the framework):** The \"Real Rapport\" framework is designed to *preempt* this objection. By using words like \"possible\" or \"maybe\" and focusing on \"looking at\" solutions or \"different options\" rather than \"getting help with\" or \"wanting to upgrade,\" the salesperson neutralizes the sales pressure.\n*   **The reframe or psychology behind the response:** The objective is to keep the prospect's guard down (\"lowers your prospect's guard\"). By not sounding prescriptive or assumptive about their readiness to buy, the salesperson avoids triggering their natural sales resistance. It validates their current exploratory mindset.\n\n### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n1.  **Prioritize Results-Based Thinking:** Immediately shift the conversation from generic pleasantries to the prospect's desired \"end results\" or outcomes, positioning yourself as an expert.\n2.  **Avoid Generic Rapport-Building:** Steer clear of common questions like \"How are you doing?\" or \"How's the weather?\" as they lower your status and make you sound like every other salesperson.\n3.  **Neutralize Sales Pressure:** Use softening language like \"possible,\" \"maybe,\" or \"just\" (in specific contexts like aged/cold leads) to keep the prospect's guard down and prevent triggering sales resistance early in the conversation.\n4.  **Practice a Slow, Confident Tone:** Deliver your opening questions slowly and deliberately, allowing the prospect time to process and internalize what you're saying, which also projects authority and competence.\n5.  **Always Repeat Back the End Result:** Clearly articulate the specific benefit or outcome the prospect is seeking, ensuring alignment and demonstrating that you understand their goals.\n\n### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION\n\nThese techniques can be powerfully applied to selling Super Patch wellness products in a direct sales/network marketing context by focusing on the *results* the patches provide rather than just the product itself.\n\n**A. Avoiding Fake Rapport (for Super Patch):**\n\n*   **DO NOT START WITH:**\n    *   \"Hey, how's your day going?\"\n    *   \"What do you do for fun?\"\n    *   \"Are you having a good week?\"\n    *   \"Heard anything about Super Patch lately?\" (Too direct, assumes familiarity/interest).\n\n**B. Building Real Rapport (for Super Patch - Generic Approach):**\n\n*   **Core Principle:** Focus on the \"end result\" or specific wellness outcome the prospect might be seeking. This makes you sound like a solution-provider, not just a product pusher.\n*   **Example Script Structure for an Inbound Lead (e.g., from a website inquiry about wellness):**\n    *   **(Initial Tech Check if Virtual):** \"Can you hear me...? Can you see me?\"\n    *   **(Transition - slow tone, look at notes):** \"Alright (looks down at notes), it looks like you reached out about looking at 'possible' help with [SPECIFIC WELLNESS CHALLENGE/GOAL] so that you can [ACHIEVE DESIRED END RESULT], right?\"\n\n**C. Specific Super Patch Application Examples:**\n\n*   **For Pain Relief (e.g., inquired about pain):**\n    *   *Script:* \"Alright, it looks like you reached out about looking at 'possible' help with **managing daily discomfort** so that you can **enjoy your activities without constant pain**, right?\"\n    *   *Alternative:* \"Looks like you were exploring 'possible' ways to **reduce that knee pain** so you can **get back to walking more comfortably**, right?\"\n    *   *End Result:* Enjoy activities without constant pain, walk more comfortably.\n\n*   **For Better Sleep (e.g., inquired about sleep issues):**\n    *   *Script:* \"Okay, I see you inquired about looking at 'possible' ways to **improve your sleep quality** so that you can **wake up feeling refreshed and energized**, right?\"\n    *   *End Result:* Wake up feeling refreshed and energized.\n\n*   **For Increased Energy (e.g., inquired about fatigue):**\n    *   *Script:* \"It looks like you were interested in 'possible' methods to **boost your natural energy levels without jitters** so you can **be more productive throughout your day**, right?\"\n    *   *End Result:* More productive throughout the day.\n\n*   **For Improved Focus/Concentration (e.g., inquired about brain fog):**\n    *   *Script:* \"Looks like you wanted to explore 'possible' ways to **enhance mental clarity and focus** so you can **concentrate better at work or during tasks**, right?\"\n    *   *End Result:* Concentrate better.\n\n*   **For Stress Reduction (e.g., inquired about anxiety/stress):**\n    *   *Script:* \"I see you were looking at 'possible' options to **manage daily stress more effectively** so you can **feel calmer and more in control**, right?\"\n    *   *End Result:* Feel calmer and more in control.\n\n*   **For Balance/Stability (e.g., inquired about feeling unsteady):**\n    *   *Script:* \"Okay, according to my notes, you were exploring 'possible' ways to **improve your stability and balance** so that you can **feel more confident on your feet**, right?\"\n    *   *End Result:* Feel more confident on your feet.\n\n*   **For Outbound/Cold-ish Leads (e.g., responded to a generic wellness ad, or a friend-of-a-friend referral where you bought the lead from someone):**\n    *   *Script:* \"Hey [Prospect Name], this is **just** [Your Name]. I **just** had a second to get back to you because I noticed you responded to a [wellness ad/post from [Friend's Name]] a little while ago about 'possibly' looking at **different natural solutions for [e.g., sleep/pain]**... Were you looking for anything specific or **just wanting to learn more about the options**...?\"\n    *   *End Result:* Learning more about options (or finding a specific solution).\n\nBy using these scripts, a Super Patch salesperson immediately positions themselves as an expert who understands the prospect's needs and desired outcomes, rather than someone just trying to push a product. This builds trust and status from the very beginning of the conversation."

## 1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW (Clinical Focus)

**Freedom** is a drug-free, non-invasive pain management solution backed by peer-reviewed clinical research. The RESTORE study (2025), published in Pain Therapeutics and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06505005), demonstrated significant improvements in pain severity, pain interference, and range of motion in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

### Clinical Mechanism
Freedom utilizes **Vibrotactile Technology (VTT)**, which leverages mechanoreceptor activation based on Nobel Prize-winning research (2021) on Piezo channels. The specialized ridge patterns:
- Stimulate A-beta nerve fibers
- Apply gate control theory principles
- Modulate nociceptive pathways
- Disrupt the neuromatrix of pain

### Key Clinical Data (RESTORE Study)
| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Study Type | Randomized, Controlled, Double-Blind |
| Participants | 118 adults with mild-to-moderate pain |
| Duration | 14 days |
| Pain Severity | Significantly greater improvement vs. placebo |
| Pain Interference | Significantly greater reduction vs. placebo |
| Range of Motion | Objective improvement at Day 7 and Day 14 |

### Practice Integration Benefits
- **Drug-Free Alternative:** First-line or adjunct therapy before pharmaceutical escalation
- **No Contraindications:** Safe to use alongside existing treatment protocols
- **Patient Self-Care:** Extends treatment benefits between appointments

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION SCRIPT (Clinical Focus)

### For Healthcare Practitioners (3-Minute Version)

**[CLINICAL PROBLEM]**
"Dr. [Name], I'm sure you see this daily – patients presenting with chronic or recurring pain who want to avoid pharmaceuticals, but have limited drug-free options that actually work. Many patients fall back on NSAIDs between visits, which can undermine your treatment progress and create long-term health concerns. And for you as a practitioner, it's frustrating to recommend solutions that lack robust clinical evidence."

**[CLINICAL EVIDENCE]**
"That's why I want to share the RESTORE study results with you. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial published in Pain Therapeutics and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. 118 patients with mild-to-moderate musculoskeletal pain, arthritis, and neuropathy were assigned to either our VTT patch or placebo.

The results showed:
- **Significantly greater pain severity reduction** in the active group
- **Significantly greater reduction in pain interference** with daily activities  
- **Objective improvement in range of motion** measured by goniometer and inclinometer at both Day 7 and Day 14

The study authors concluded that clinicians should consider this 'as a potential first-line or adjunct therapy to treat pain.'"

**[PRACTICE SOLUTION]**
"The Freedom patch uses Vibrotactile Technology – specialized ridge patterns that activate mechanoreceptors and modulate pain pathways through the same neural mechanisms that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine. It's completely drug-free, has no contraindications with your existing treatments, and gives patients an evidence-based self-care option between appointments.

For your practice, this means:
- A clinically-validated drug-free option you can confidently recommend
- Extended treatment benefits between visits
- An additional revenue stream with 25% practitioner margin
- Differentiation in your market with cutting-edge technology

Would you like me to walk through how other [practitioner type] practices are integrating Freedom into their treatment protocols?"

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING (Evidence-Based Responses)

### 1. "I need to see the clinical evidence first."
**Response:** "Absolutely, and I respect that evidence-based approach – it's exactly why we invested in a double-blind RCT. Let me send you the RESTORE study directly. It's published in Pain Therapeutics and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT06505005. 118 patients, 14-day duration, significant outcomes across pain severity, interference, and ROM. What specific aspects would you like to review?"

### 2. "My patients have tried patches before with no success."
**Response:** "I understand – there are many transdermal patches on the market with mixed results. What makes VTT fundamentally different is that it's not delivering any substance into the body. It works through mechanoreceptor activation, applying gate control theory principles to modulate pain pathways. The RESTORE study specifically tested this against a placebo patch that looked identical, and the VTT group showed significantly better outcomes. Would it help to see the mechanism of action diagram alongside the study data?"

### 3. "How do I know this isn't just placebo effect?"
**Response:** "That's exactly why we conducted a placebo-controlled study. Both groups received identical-looking patches – the only difference was the VTT ridge patterns. The active group showed statistically significant improvements in pain severity, pain interference, AND objective ROM measurements using goniometers and inclinometers. These objective measurements can't be influenced by placebo effect. Would you like to review the methodology section of the study?"

### 4. "I'm not sure my patients would pay for this."
**Response:** "I understand cost is a consideration for patients. Let me ask – what are your patients currently spending on pain management between visits? Many are buying NSAIDs, topical creams, or other OTC products monthly. Freedom typically costs less than ongoing OTC purchases while offering clinically-proven results without the GI side effects of NSAIDs. Plus, at your practitioner pricing with 25% margin, you can offer it competitively while adding revenue to your practice. What do your patients typically spend on pain-related self-care?"

### 5. "I already recommend [competitor product - CBD, TENS, etc.]."
**Response:** "That's great that you're already offering alternatives. What results have your patients experienced with [competitor]? [Listen] VTT actually complements many existing modalities. Unlike CBD which works through endocannabinoid pathways, or TENS which requires equipment and compliance, Freedom works through mechanoreceptor-mediated neural modulation. Many practitioners use it alongside their current protocols for enhanced outcomes. Would you be open to trying it with a few patients to compare results?"

### 6. "I need to think about it / discuss with my practice partners."
**Response:** "Of course – this is an important decision for your practice. What specific questions would help you and your partners evaluate this? I can provide the full clinical study, mechanism of action documentation, and even connect you with practitioners who've integrated Freedom into similar practices. What information would be most helpful for your decision?"

### 7. "I'm skeptical of wellness patches in general."
**Response:** "I appreciate your skepticism – it shows you care about what you recommend to patients. That's exactly why we pursued rigorous clinical validation. The RESTORE study was specifically designed to address skepticism: randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and published in a peer-reviewed journal. We're not asking you to recommend something on faith – we're presenting evidence. Would reviewing the study methodology and results help address your concerns?"

### 8. "What's in it for me? / Why should I retail this?"
**Response:** "Great question. Beyond the clinical benefits for your patients, there's a clear business case: 25% practitioner margin creates a new revenue stream. But more importantly, it positions your practice as offering cutting-edge, evidence-based solutions. Patients stay engaged with your care between visits, compliance improves, and outcomes enhance – which drives referrals and retention. What aspects of practice growth are most important to you right now?"

## 7. CLOSING SCRIPTS (Partnership-Focused)

### Pre-Close Check
Before closing, confirm alignment:
- "Based on our conversation, it sounds like a drug-free, clinically-validated pain option aligns with your practice philosophy. Is that accurate?"
- "Do you have any remaining questions about the clinical evidence or how this would integrate into your protocols?"

### 1. The Practitioner Starter Close
"Dr. [Name], the best way for you to evaluate Freedom for your practice is to experience it with a few patients. Our Practitioner Starter Program includes [X patches] at your 25% discount, along with patient education materials and the full clinical study PDF. This lets you trial it with patients and see results firsthand. Should I set that up for you today?"

### 2. The Clinical Confidence Close
"Given the strength of the RESTORE study data and your focus on evidence-based treatment, I think you'll find Freedom becomes a valuable part of your pain management toolkit. We offer practitioner accounts with 25% off retail, direct ordering, and full clinical documentation. Shall we get your account established so you can start offering this to appropriate patients?"

### 3. The Patient Demand Close
"Dr. [Name], patients are increasingly asking for drug-free pain options. By having Freedom available in your practice, you're meeting that demand with a clinically-validated solution rather than sending them to Amazon for unproven alternatives. Would you like to start with an initial order to see how your patients respond?"

### 4. The Comparison Close
"Would you prefer to start with our Practitioner Starter Kit to trial with a few patients first, or would you like to set up a full practitioner account with ongoing ordering capabilities at your 25% discount?"

### 5. The Referral Program Close
"If reselling to patients isn't the right model for your practice, we also have a referral program where you recommend Freedom to patients and they purchase directly, with tracking back to your practice for referral benefits. Which model would work better for your practice – wholesale/retail or referral?"

You've learned they have pain patients. Present the Freedom patch specifically.

## Your Presentation

"So Freedom is our flagship patch for pain. Here's what's cool about it:

The clinical evidence - we did a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 118 participants with chronic pain over 14 days. Published in Pain Therapeutics journal. Significant reduction in pain AND improvement in range of motion. It's registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT06505005 if you want to look it up.

How it works - the patch has these raised geometric patterns that stimulate mechanoreceptors in the skin. These are the same receptors that Nobel Prize-winning research identified. It signals through neural pathways to modulate pain perception. No drugs, nothing absorbed.

For your patients - they apply it in the morning, it lasts all day. No pills to remember, no side effects to worry about. Works out to about three dollars a day.

For your {ctx['short']} patients specifically, it's great between adjustments when they might otherwise reach for NSAIDs."

We had participants who were averaging over an hour to fall asleep. By the end of the study, that dropped to about 37 minutes. But here's the big one - 80% of participants who were using sleep medications were able to stop using them.

And unlike sleep meds, there's no morning grogginess. Patients wake up feeling rested, not foggy. No tolerance buildup either - day 30 works as well as day 1.

How they use it - they apply it about an hour before bed. The VTT technology signals the nervous system to shift into rest mode. Same mechanism as Freedom, just different neural pathways.

Here's how it works - the same VTT technology, but the pattern is designed to signal the parasympathetic nervous system. You know that shift from fight-or-flight to rest-and-digest? That's what we're supporting.

Patients wear it during the day, especially during high-stress periods. Some use it specifically before stressful situations - meetings, travel, whatever triggers them.

The beauty for your patients - it's not a sedative. They're not foggy or drowsy. They just feel... more even. More able to handle what comes.

The study showed 31% improvement in balance scores. That's huge for patients dealing with stability issues - whether it's age-related, post-injury, or neurological.

How it works - the patch is worn on the upper back, near C7. The VTT pattern sends signals that help with proprioception - the body's sense of where it is in space.

For your senior patients especially, this can be life-changing. Falls are such a big deal - anything that improves stability is valuable.

It works out to about three dollars a day. For patients who would otherwise buy daily supplements - glucosamine, turmeric, whatever - it's comparable or less.

For patients dealing with chronic issues, think about what they're already spending. OTC pain relievers add up. Sleep aids add up. And those often come with side effects.

The other thing - there's no tolerance buildup with VTT. Day 30 works as well as day 1. With a lot of other things, you need more and more over time.

## Your Response

"Oh that's great - that tells me your patients trust your recommendations, which is huge.

Here's the thing though - SuperPatch isn't really competing with supplements. Supplements work internally through chemistry. VTT works externally through neural pathways. Totally different mechanism.

A lot of {ctx['short']} use both. Like, they'll recommend turmeric for inflammation AND Freedom for pain signaling. Different approaches, same goal.

They're uncomfortable with the idea of selling to patients.

## Your Response

"Totally understand that concern. A lot of practitioners feel the same way - you got into this to help people, not to be a salesperson.

Here's the thing though - your patients are already buying something. They're buying supplements, or pain relievers, or sleep aids from Amazon or Walgreens or wherever. They're just doing it without your guidance.

When you recommend something, you're not selling - you're guiding. And that's valuable.

"You know, that's what a lot of {ctx['short']} say at first. But here's the thing - patients don't need to believe in it. They just need to experience it.

Think about it this way: when you first explain [chiropractic/massage/acupuncture] to a new patient, do they fully understand how it works? Probably not. But they feel better afterward, so they keep coming back.

Same thing here. The mechanism is sophisticated - neural signaling through mechanoreceptors - but the patient experience is simple. They put on a patch, they feel better. That's what matters to them.

Most practitioners start by trying it themselves. Once you feel it, you understand. Then you try it on a few open-minded patients. Once they feel it, they become your evangelists."

"So let me tell you how {ctx['short']} typically work with us. There are basically three options:

**WHOLESALE** - You buy at 25% off retail, stock the patches in your practice, sell directly to patients. You control pricing, you keep the margin. Best if you already retail products.

**AFFILIATE** - We give you a unique referral link or code. You recommend, patients order from us, you earn commission on every sale. No inventory, no transactions. Best if you just want to recommend and not deal with retail.

**HYBRID** - Mix of both. Stock your top 2-3 products on hand, use affiliate for everything else. Best of both worlds.

You get 25% off retail pricing. So the patches that retail for around $90 for a month's supply, you pay about $67. You can price them however you want - most practitioners do full retail or a small markup.

Most start with our Practitioner Starter Kit - it has samples of each main patch plus patient education materials. About $300 to start.

Reordering is easy - online portal, free shipping on orders over $150.

We also give you marketing materials - patient brochures, display materials, that kind of thing.

The advantage is you have it on hand. Patient mentions pain? You can hand them Freedom right there. Immediate solution."

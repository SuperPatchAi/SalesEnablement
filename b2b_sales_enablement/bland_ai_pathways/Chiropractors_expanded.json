Present the Freedom patch specifically.\n\n## Your Presentation\n\n\"So Freedom is our flagship patch for pain. Here's what's cool about it:\n\nThe clinical evidence - we did a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 118 participants with chronic pain over 14 days. Published in Pain Therapeutics journal. Significant reduction in pain AND improvement in range of motion. It's registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT06505005 if you want to look it up.\n\nHow it works - the patch has these raised geometric patterns that stimulate mechanoreceptors in the skin. These are the same receptors that Nobel Prize-winning research identified. It signals through neural pathways to modulate pain perception. No drugs, nothing absorbed.\n\nFor your patients - they apply it in the morning, it lasts all day. No pills to remember, no side effects to worry about. Works out to about three dollars a day.\n\nFor your DCs patients specifically, it's great between adjustments when they might otherwise reach for NSAIDs.\"\n\n## After Presenting:\n\nIF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS:\n\u2192 Route to relevant objection node based on question\n\nIF THEY SEEM INTERESTED:\n\u2192 Route to \"Business Model Options\"\nSay: \"Want me to tell you how DCs typically work with us?\"\n\nIF THEY'RE SKEPTICAL:\n\u2192 Route to \"Objection: Need Research\"\n\n## What NOT to Do\n- Don't oversell or make medical claims\n- Don't rush through the clinical data\n- Pause for their reactions"

Let me share the study results:\n\nWe had participants who were averaging over an hour to fall asleep. By the end of the study, that dropped to about 37 minutes. But here's the big one - 80% of participants who were using sleep medications were able to stop using them.\n\nAnd unlike sleep meds, there's no morning grogginess. Patients wake up feeling rested, not foggy. No tolerance buildup either - day 30 works as well as day 1.\n\nHow they use it - they apply it about an hour before bed. The VTT technology signals the nervous system to shift into rest mode. Same mechanism as Freedom, just different neural pathways.\n\nFor your patients who've tried melatonin, tried sleep apps, tried everything - this is something different. It works through touch, not chemistry.\"\n\n## After Presenting:\n\nIF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS:\n\u2192 Route to relevant objection node\n\nIF INTERESTED IN MORE PRODUCTS:\n\u2192 Route to \"Present: Product Overview\" \n\nIF READY TO MOVE FORWARD:\n\u2192 Route to \"Business Model Options\"\n\n## What NOT to Do\n- Don't promise it replaces medical treatment\n- Don't claim it cures insomnia\n- Present it as a drug-free support option"

You know that shift from fight-or-flight to rest-and-digest? That's what we're supporting.\n\nPatients wear it during the day, especially during high-stress periods. Some use it specifically before stressful situations - meetings, travel, whatever triggers them.\n\nThe beauty for your patients - it's not a sedative. They're not foggy or drowsy. They just feel... more even. More able to handle what comes.\n\nA lot of DCs actually try this one themselves first because stress is universal, right?

That's huge for patients dealing with stability issues - whether it's age-related, post-injury, or neurological.\n\nHow it works - the patch is worn on the upper back, near C7. The VTT pattern sends signals that help with proprioception - the body's sense of where it is in space.\n\nFor your senior patients especially, this can be life-changing. Falls are such a big deal - anything that improves stability is valuable.\n\nThe feedback we get is patients feel more confident moving.

Popular with fatigued patients.\n\n**For Focus:** Focus - cognitive support, great for brain fog.\n\n**For Immune Support:** Defend - supports immune function naturally.\n\nWe have 13 patches total, but those are the ones most DCs start with.

For patients who would otherwise buy daily supplements - glucosamine, turmeric, whatever - it's comparable or less.\n\nFor patients dealing with chronic issues, think about what they're already spending. OTC pain relievers add up. Sleep aids add up. And those often come with side effects.\n\nThe other thing - there's no tolerance buildup with VTT. Day 30 works as well as day 1.

Here's how wholesale works:\n\nYou get 25% off retail pricing. So the patches that retail for around $90 for a month's supply, you pay about $67. You can price them however you want - most practitioners do full retail or a small markup.\n\nMost start with our Practitioner Starter Kit - it has samples of each main patch plus patient education materials. About $300 to start.\n\nReordering is easy - online portal, free shipping on orders over $150.\n\nWe also give you marketing materials - patient brochures, display materials, that kind of thing.\n\nThe advantage is you have it on hand. Patient mentions pain? You can hand them Freedom right there.

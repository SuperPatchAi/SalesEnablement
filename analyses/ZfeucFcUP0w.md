### 2. KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

**1. Take a Breath**
    *   **Step-by-step process:** (Implied)
        1.  Acknowledge that sales can be stressful, especially for beginners who often experience constant anxiety.
        2.  Take time to relax and mentally prepare.
        3.  Clarify your sales process and overall path to success.
        4.  Identify ways to "short circuit" your learning curve.
    *   **Psychology/Principle:** Reduces anxiety and stress, allowing for clearer thinking and a more strategic approach to selling. It shifts from reactive fear to proactive planning.

**2. Be Willing to Screw Up**
    *   **Step-by-step process:**
        1.  Accept that you will make mistakes (pissing people off, frustrating people, losing sales).
        2.  View these mistakes as an integral part of the learning process.
        3.  Learn from failures quickly ("fail fast").
    *   **Psychology/Principle:** Takes immense pressure off, allowing you "the permission to just learn." This mindset fosters faster learning and adaptation, as fear of failure is removed. Without this willingness, a salesperson "will not last in sales."

**3. Follow a Process From Day 1**
    *   **Step-by-step process:**
        1.  Identify a proven, already successful sales process.
        2.  Model this process diligently.
        3.  Learn and incorporate it into your daily selling activities.
        4.  Be successful "right away" by leveraging established best practices.
    *   **Psychology/Principle:** Short-circuits the learning curve by avoiding years of trial-and-error. It provides a structured roadmap to success, preventing aimless "throwing a big pot of spaghetti at the wall."

**4. Drop the Enthusiasm**
    *   **Step-by-step process:**
        1.  Avoid exhibiting excessive passion or enthusiasm for your product/service.
        2.  Focus on your process rather than trying to project enthusiasm.
    *   **Psychology/Principle:** Over-the-top enthusiasm sounds inauthentic and makes you indistinguishable from "every other dope salesperson" your prospect has encountered. It creates skepticism rather than trust.

**5. Be Firm and Real**
    *   **Step-by-step process:**
        1.  Adopt a genuine, firm, and authentic tone and demeanor.
        2.  Avoid "fake voice" commonly associated with overly enthusiastic salespeople.
        3.  Present yourself as a leader who guides the prospect through a clear process.
    *   **Psychology/Principle:** Positions the salesperson as a trusted leader, as prospects "ultimately want to be led through a process." This approach builds credibility, separates you from competitors, and makes prospects "much more likely to close deals."

**6. Script Out Everything**
    *   **Step-by-step process:**
        1.  Create and utilize a script for "every aspect of sales," including prospecting calls, discovery conversations, and presentations.
        2.  Practice the script until you are "good at using your script," making it sound natural and unscripted.
    *   **Psychology/Principle:** Scripts are "one of the keys to short-circuiting success." They cut out "all the fat," keep conversations "on track," and ensure the "right process" is followed, leading to efficient and effective communication.

**7. Disqualify**
    *   **Step-by-step process:**
        1.  Do not attempt to persuade or convince prospects; instead, "take them through a disqualification process."
        2.  First, "determine if they're a fit" (recognizing that "half of your prospects are not a fit in the first place"). Disqualify those who are not a fit.
        3.  For those who are a potential fit, ask a "specific set of questions to really determine if they're a fit."
        4.  Use this process to "build real value."
    *   **Psychology/Principle:** Prospects "don't need to be persuaded" or "convinced." They need to "believe that you can help them solve their challenges." This method saves time, focuses effort on qualified leads, and builds trust by demonstrating that you're only working with those you can genuinely help.

**8. Cut Your Presentation in Half**
    *   **Step-by-step process:**
        1.  Take your planned presentation time and "cut it in half." (Ideally, aim for no slides).
        2.  Base the presentation entirely on the insights gathered during the disqualification/discovery conversation.
        3.  Focus on the "challenges that they have."
        4.  Allow "your prospects' questions [to] drive the rest of the conversation."
    *   **Psychology/Principle:** Prevents information overload and demonstrates that you have listened and understood their specific needs. A "great presentation is going to be based on the disqualification conversation." It's not a "show and tell time" but a focused effort to "demonstrate that we can solve their challenges."

**9. Model Success**
    *   **Step-by-step process:**
        1.  Identify a process that you "believe is good," "is going to work," and "is proven to work."
        2.  "Follow that time and time again."
        3.  Do not try to "figure this stuff out on your own."
    *   **Psychology/Principle:** Provides a shortcut to achieving results by learning from those who have already succeeded. It removes the guesswork and provides a clear, reliable path to sales effectiveness.

### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS

*   **Introducing the Process (Firm & Real):**
    *   "George, let me share with you exactly what we're going to be talking about."

*   **General:** The video emphasizes the *necessity* of scripting out "everything" but does not provide specific word-for-word examples for other stages like discovery questions, closing phrases, or follow-up messages. The core message is *to create and master your own scripts* based on the proven process.

---

### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING

*   **Common Objection:** "Oh, well, if I use a script, it makes me sound scripted."
*   **Recommended Response:** "Well, the reason you sound scripted when you use a script is because you're bad at using your script. I mean, if every actor said, 'Oh, I don't like to use a script,' well, there would be no movie or TV industry. Great actors are by definition good at following the script. You can do the same. Just get really good at using your script."
*   **Reframe/Psychology:** This reframes the issue from the script itself being inherently bad to the salesperson's lack of practice and skill in delivering it. It encourages mastery over abandonment, using the powerful analogy of acting.

### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1.  **Embrace Mistakes for Faster Learning:** Don't fear failure; view mistakes as opportunities to learn quickly ("fail fast") and reduce performance pressure.
2.  **Adopt a Proven Process from Day 1:** Short-circuit your learning curve by modeling and consistently following an established, successful sales process.
3.  **Be Real and Leading, Not Enthusiastic:** Focus on authentic communication and leading prospects through a clear process, rather than relying on artificial enthusiasm.
4.  **Script and Practice Every Interaction:** Develop and master scripts for all sales stages to ensure clarity, focus, and consistent execution of your process.
5.  **Disqualify and Focus on Their Needs:** Prioritize identifying true fits and tailoring your interactions (especially presentations) to prospects' specific challenges, rather than trying to convince everyone.

### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION

These techniques can be powerfully applied to selling Super Patch wellness products in a direct sales/network marketing context:

1.  **Take a Breath & Be Willing to Screw Up:**
    *   **Application:** Selling innovative wellness products like Super Patch often involves explaining new technology. Don't be afraid if you stumble on a scientific explanation or if a prospect asks a question you can't immediately answer. It's okay to say, "That's a great question, I'm going to find the precise answer for you and get back to you," rather than fabricating an answer. Your early pitches won't be perfect, but each one is a learning opportunity.

2.  **Follow a Process From Day 1 & Script Out Everything:**
    *   **Application:** Instead of just showcasing all 10+ Super Patch products randomly, learn a structured process for Super Patch sales.
    *   **Example Process:**
        1.  **Initial Connection (Scripted):** "Hi [Name], thanks for connecting. My goal today is just to understand what you're hoping to achieve for your wellness and see if Super Patch might be a good fit. Sound fair?"
        2.  **Discovery/Disqualification (Scripted Questions):** "You mentioned [initial pain point, e.g., trouble sleeping]. How long have you been dealing with that, and what have you tried so far?"
            *   "On a scale of 1-10, how important is it to find a natural, non-invasive solution for [problem] *right now*?" (If low, you might disqualify or suggest they revisit later).
        3.  **Tailored Presentation (Short & Scripted):** Based on their #1 pain point (e.g., sleep), only introduce the **Rem Patch**.
            *   "Based on what you've shared about your challenges with [sleep], I believe the **Rem Patch** could be incredibly beneficial. It works by sending unique neuro-sensory cues to your brain's limbic system, which is crucial for sleep regulation, helping your body naturally improve sleep quality and duration. Does that sound like it could help you get the restorative sleep you're looking for?" (This cuts out explaining *all* patches).
        4.  **Call to Action (Scripted):** "The best way to know if this is right for you is to experience it yourself. I recommend starting with a 30-day supply of the Rem Patch. Shall I walk you through the simple order process?"

3.  **Drop the Enthusiasm & Be Firm and Real:**
    *   **Application:** Avoid phrases like, "Oh my goodness, these patches are revolutionary! You absolutely HAVE to try them, they changed my life!"
    *   **Instead:** Be calmly confident. "Many people dealing with [prospect's specific pain] have found significant relief with the [specific Super Patch]. My process is to understand your unique needs, explain how the technology addresses them, and then suggest a trial so you can experience it firsthand." This positions you as a knowledgeable guide rather than a desperate seller.

4.  **Disqualify Early:**
    *   **Application:** Don't waste time trying to convince someone who has no interest in natural wellness solutions or is unwilling to invest in their health.
    *   **Example Disqualification:** After discussing their problem, ask: "Based on what we've covered, do you see how this technology could potentially help you with [problem]? And if it could, are you open to trying a non-pharmaceutical solution like this?" If they show significant hesitation or resistance to the core concept, gracefully disengage.

5.  **Cut Your Presentation in Half:**
    *   **Application:** If a prospect is interested in pain relief, focus *only* on the **Flow Patch** and its benefits for pain. Don't launch into a full overview of all 15 patches, the company history, or the entire science behind every technology.
    *   **Example Focus:** "You mentioned consistent [shoulder pain]. The Flow Patch uses [brief explanation of technology related to pain pathways] to help reduce that discomfort and improve your mobility. Many users report feeling a difference quite quickly. Would you like to know more about how it specifically works for *your* type of pain?" Let *their* questions about their shoulder pain guide the deeper dive.

6.  **Model Success:**
    *   **Application:** In direct sales, it's crucial to find a successful upline or team member whose process works. Don't try to invent your own Super Patch presentation from scratch. Follow the scripts, processes, and training provided by successful leaders within your organization. Attend trainings, listen to call recordings, and practice what works for others rather than experimenting randomly.

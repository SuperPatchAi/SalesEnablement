# Super Patch Lumi: Comprehensive Healthcare Practitioner Sales Guide

Welcome, Super Patch B2B Sales Team!

This comprehensive Word Track document is your essential guide to introducing and selling Super Patch Lumi to healthcare practitioners. Beauty and skin health are increasingly sought in integrative and naturopathic practices. Lumi offers neural pathway support for radiance and natural glow without invasive procedures or topical chemicals.

***

## 1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW (Clinical Focus)

**Lumi** is Super Patch's drug-free beauty support solution, designed to promote radiant skin and natural glow through Vibrotactile Technology (VTT). Lumi works by activating neural pathways that support skin health and vitality from within.

### Clinical Mechanism of Action

Lumi's VTT works through evidence-based mechanisms:
- **Neural-Skin Axis:** Activates pathways connecting nervous system to skin function
- **Circulation Support:** Supports healthy blood flow to skin tissues
- **Stress-Skin Connection:** Calms pathways that negatively impact skin appearance
- **Collagen Support Pathways:** Works with natural skin regeneration systems

### Key Differentiators vs. Beauty Interventions

| Feature | Injectables | Topical Products | VTT (Lumi) |
|---------|------------|------------------|------------|
| Mechanism | Physical/chemical intervention | External application | Neural pathway activation |
| Invasive | Yes | No | **No** |
| Chemical Exposure | Some | Yes | **None** |
| Systemic Support | No | No | **Yes** |
| Root Cause Address | No | No | **Supportive** |
| Side Effects | Possible | Possible | **Minimal** |

### Practice Integration Benefits
- **Inside-Out Approach:** Supports beauty through wellness rather than intervention
- **Complements Protocols:** Works alongside nutrition and skincare recommendations
- **No Chemicals:** Drug-free approach to skin health
- **Holistic Philosophy:** Aligns with integrative practice values

## 3. OPENING SCRIPTS

### 1. Cold Call Script

"Good morning, this is [Your Name] from Super Patch. I'm reaching out to practitioners who support patient skin health and might be interested in an inside-out approach.

Our Lumi patch uses Vibrotactile Technology to support skin radiance through neural pathway activation – it works from within rather than topically, aligning with the philosophy that beauty reflects internal health.

Do you have patients seeking natural skin support without invasive procedures or chemical interventions?

[Listen]

Would it be helpful if I sent information on how VTT supports skin health pathways and how practitioners are using Lumi?"

### 2. Email Introduction Script

**Subject:** Inside-Out Beauty Support for Your Patients (Non-Invasive)

"Dr. [Name],

Skin health is increasingly a concern patients bring to integrative practitioners – they want radiance and glow but not through invasive procedures or chemical-laden products.

Our Lumi patch offers inside-out support:
- VTT activates neural pathways supporting skin health
- Supports circulation and cellular vitality to skin
- Drug-free, non-invasive, no chemicals
- Based on Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research

For your practice, this means:
✓ Beauty support aligned with wellness philosophy

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION SCRIPT (2-Minute)

**(Problem-Agitate-Solve-Evidence Framework)**

**(PROBLEM)**

"Skin health has become a major patient concern – they want to look radiant and youthful but increasingly distrust invasive procedures and chemical-laden products. They come to integrative practitioners because they want beauty that reflects true wellness.

But the options have been limited – you can recommend good nutrition, stress management, and skincare, but patients want more active support."

**(AGITATE)**

"The beauty industry has conditioned patients to expect quick fixes – but those fixes often don't last, require ongoing maintenance, and don't address the internal factors affecting skin health.

Meanwhile, stress, hormones, and internal health significantly impact skin appearance. Patients treating only the outside are missing the inside."

**(SOLVE)**

"That's why Lumi is such a valuable addition to skin wellness protocols. It supports skin health through Vibrotactile Technology – activating neural pathways that influence circulation, cellular vitality, and the nervous system's connection to skin function.

It's inside-out support – working with the body's natural skin health pathways rather than applying something externally. Patients get support for radiance and glow while you address root causes through nutrition and lifestyle."

**(EVIDENCE)**

"The science foundation is mechanoreceptor research that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine. The neural-skin axis is well-documented – nervous system signaling influences skin health.

For your patients, this means beauty support that aligns with their wellness values – inside-out, drug-free, non-invasive. For your practice, it means offering comprehensive skin health that goes beyond recommendations.

Would you like to integrate Lumi into your skin wellness protocols?"

***

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### 1. "Skin health requires nutrition and lifestyle – not patches."

**Response:** "I completely agree – nutrition, hydration, and stress management are foundational. Lumi doesn't replace those recommendations.

It adds neural pathway support that enhances what you're already doing. Think of it as activating the pathways that help nutrients and lifestyle changes benefit the skin. Does that complementary role make sense?"

### 2. "How can a patch affect skin appearance?"

**Response:** "Good question. The mechanism is the neural-skin axis – documented connections between nervous system signaling and skin health.

VTT activates mechanoreceptors that influence circulation and cellular support pathways to skin. It's working through the nervous system rather than topically. Would understanding the pathway in more detail help?"

### 3. "My patients expect visible, dramatic results."

**Response:** "That expectation is set by procedures and filters – it's not sustainable or healthy. Lumi provides supportive wellness, not dramatic alteration.

Positioning it as 'supporting your skin's natural radiance from within' sets appropriate expectations for sustainable beauty. How do you typically frame skin health conversations?"

### 4. "What about patients with serious skin conditions?"

**Response:** "Dermatological conditions need medical treatment. Lumi isn't replacing that.

For general skin wellness, aging support, and patients who want to enhance their skin's natural health, Lumi provides drug-free assistance. Would that population be relevant for your practice?"

### 5. "Topical products are more direct for skin."

**Response:** "Topicals address the outside, and they have a role. But skin health is also influenced by internal factors – circulation, stress, nutrition, nervous system signaling.

Lumi provides inside-out support that complements topical care. Many patients find combining approaches produces the best results. Does that holistic approach align with your practice?"

### 6. "This seems expensive compared to skincare products."

**Response:** "Many patients spend significantly on topical products with diminishing returns. Lumi offers a different mechanism – internal support that works regardless of what they apply topically.

For patients seeking comprehensive skin wellness, adding inside-out support can enhance everything else they're doing. What do your patients invest in skin health?"

### 7. "I don't do aesthetic services."

**Response:** "Lumi isn't an aesthetic service – it's wellness support for skin health. It fits naturally alongside your other wellness recommendations.

Patients increasingly see skin as a marker of overall health, which is exactly your wheelhouse. Would offering skin wellness support as part of comprehensive care be valuable?"

### 8. "Is there research specifically on skin appearance?"

**Response:** "The underlying mechanism – neural-skin axis support through VTT – is based on established science.

For your practice, trialing Lumi with patients and observing their skin over time would provide direct evidence. Would a pilot approach work for evaluating effectiveness?"

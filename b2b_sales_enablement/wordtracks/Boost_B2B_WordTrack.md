## 1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW (Clinical Focus)

**Boost** provides drug-free, stimulant-free energy support using Vibrotactile Technology (VTT). Unlike caffeine or stimulant-based solutions, Boost works through neural pathway activation based on Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research (2021).

### Clinical Mechanism
Boost utilizes specialized VTT ridge patterns that:
- Activate mechanoreceptors in the skin
- Modulate neural energy and alertness pathways
- Support natural vitality without stimulant dependency
- Provide sustained energy without crashes or jitters

### Key Differentiators
| Feature | Caffeine/Stimulants | VTT (Boost) |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| Mechanism | Chemical stimulation | Neural pathway activation |
| Crash | Yes | No |
| Dependency | Possible | None |
| Sleep Impact | Disrupts | None |
| Contraindications | Many | None |

### Practice Integration Benefits
- **Caffeine-Free Alternative:** For patients who can't tolerate stimulants
- **No Contraindications:** Safe alongside medications and treatments
- **Sustained Energy:** No crash undermining daily function
- **Complements Treatments:** Patients have energy for exercise, therapy, daily activities

## 3. OPENING SCRIPTS

### 1. Cold Call
"Good morning, this is [Your Name] from Super Patch. I'm reaching out because many practitioners are looking for stimulant-free energy options for patients who can't tolerate caffeine. Our Boost patch uses Vibrotactile Technology – based on Nobel Prize-winning research – to support natural energy pathways without chemicals or crashes. Do you have patients who need energy support but can't use stimulants?"

### 2. Email Introduction
**Subject:** Stimulant-Free Energy Option for Your Patients

"Dr. [Name],

Fatigue affects treatment compliance across virtually every condition. Yet many patients can't tolerate caffeine due to anxiety, heart conditions, sleep issues, or medication interactions.

Our Boost patch provides drug-free energy support through Vibrotactile Technology – neural pathway activation rather than chemical stimulation. No caffeine, no crash, no contraindications.

Would you be open to discussing how this could help your fatigued patients?

Best regards,
[Your Name]"

## 4. DISCOVERY QUESTIONS

1. "What percentage of your patients complain of fatigue affecting their daily function?"
2. "How does low energy impact compliance with your treatment recommendations?"
3. "What do you currently recommend for patients who need energy but can't use caffeine?"
4. "Are your patients relying on energy drinks or excessive coffee? How is that working?"
5. "Would a drug-free, stimulant-free energy option fill a gap in your practice?"

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION (2-Minute)

**[PROBLEM]**
"Fatigue is epidemic – and it undermines everything. Patients can't exercise, can't focus on recovery, can't comply with your recommendations when they're exhausted. But the standard solutions – caffeine, energy drinks, stimulants – create their own problems: anxiety, sleep disruption, crashes, and dependency."

**[SOLUTION]**
"Boost offers a fundamentally different approach. Using Vibrotactile Technology based on Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research, Boost activates natural energy pathways through neural stimulation – not chemical stimulation. There's nothing going into the body, no caffeine, no stimulants. Patients report sustained energy without jitters or crashes, and it doesn't interfere with sleep or medications.

For your practice, this means: a drug-free option for fatigued patients, better treatment compliance, and 25% practitioner margin. Would you like to trial this with appropriate patients?"

---

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Energy issues are usually symptoms of other problems."
**Response:** "Absolutely – and that's what you're treating. But here's the reality: fatigued patients can't comply with exercise recommendations, can't engage fully in therapy, and often turn to harmful solutions. Boost provides supportive energy while you address root causes. It's about enabling your treatment plan, not replacing it."

### "How can a patch provide energy without stimulants?"
**Response:** "VTT works through mechanoreceptor activation – the same pathways that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine. Rather than flooding the system with caffeine or other chemicals, it supports neural pathways that regulate energy and alertness naturally. Think of it as optimizing the body's own energy systems rather than forcing stimulation."

### "My patients need to fix their lifestyle, not use more products."
**Response:** "I agree lifestyle is foundational. And Boost can help bridge the gap while patients implement those changes. Having energy to exercise, prepare healthy meals, and engage with life makes lifestyle change possible. It's a tool to enable the changes you're recommending."

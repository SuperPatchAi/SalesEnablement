But think of it this way: when clients ask what they can do at home, you're providing a solution, not selling. It's part of comprehensive care. You probably already recommend stretches or self-massage techniques, right? This is just another tool in that toolkit.\"\n\n**If they say: \"My clients won't want to spend more money.\"**\nRespond: \"That's a fair concern. Here's what I've found: clients who value massage already understand investing in their wellness. At about $3 per day, it's less than their daily latte. And if it helps them maintain benefits longer, they might actually need fewer sessions \u2013 which could save them money. Which clients come to mind who really struggle between appointments?\"\n\n**If they say: \"I've tried retail and it didn't work.\"**\nRespond: \"What happened? [Listen] I hear that a lot \u2013 usually it's because the products weren't a natural fit for the service, or they were hard to explain. Patches are different. You literally just say 'Wear this for pain relief between sessions' and hand it to them. There's nothing to explain about application or dosing. Would a simpler product make retail more appealing?\"\n\n**If they say: \"How is this different from menthol patches?\"**\nRespond: \"Great question! Menthol patches work by delivering a substance through the skin that creates a cooling sensation. SuperPatch doesn't deliver anything \u2013 it's purely the physical pattern stimulating touch receptors. No smell, no chemicals, no mess. For clients sensitive to menthol or who want something truly drug-free, this is a completely different category.\"\n\n**If they say: \"I'd want to try it first.\"**\nRespond: \"Absolutely \u2013 you should experience it before recommending it. Which do you deal with yourself \u2013 pain, stress, sleep issues, low energy? Let me send you a sample of the patch that fits your needs. Once you feel it work, the recommendation to clients becomes natural.\"\n\n**If they say: \"I don't have space to stock products.\"**\nRespond: \"I hear you \u2013 space is always tight. Here's the thing: the patches are small and don't expire quickly. You could literally keep them in a drawer and just pull one out when relevant. Or we can set you up with an affiliate link \u2013 you recommend, they order online, and you earn commission without stocking anything. Which would work better for you?\"\n\n**GENERAL APPROACH:**\n1. Acknowledge their concern (\"I understand...\")\n2. Provide relevant information or evidence\n3. Ask a question to re-engage them\n\nAfter handling the objection:\n- If resolved positively \u2192 route back to \"Product Presentation\" or \"Business Model Discussion\"\n- If they have more concerns \u2192 stay in objection handling\n- If they want to end the call \u2192 route to \"Polite Exit\"\n",

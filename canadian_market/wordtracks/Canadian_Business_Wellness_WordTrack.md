### The VTT Difference

SuperPatch uses **Vibrotactile Technology** - specialized tactile patterns that interact with the skin's mechanoreceptors to trigger natural neural responses. This is based on Nobel Prize-winning research (2021) on mechanoreceptors. Unlike pharmaceutical solutions, VTT works *with* the body's own systems rather than introducing foreign substances.

Hi [Name],

When one of your employees calls in sick or shows up exhausted and stressed, you feel it directly in your business. Unlike big companies that can absorb those costs, every missed day and every drop in productivity hits your bottom line.

That's why I wanted to introduce SuperPatch - a simple, drug-free wellness solution that helps your employees:
• Sleep better (no more dragging through the day)
• Feel less pain (without popping pills)
• Handle stress (without burning out)
• Stay energized (without the caffeine crashes)

It's not another complicated wellness program. It's a patch they wear that actually works - and businesses are seeing 20-30% fewer sick days as a result.

The best part? It's affordable for businesses of any size and takes zero administrative time from you.

Interested in learning more? I can explain everything in a 10-minute call.

## 5. VALUE PRESENTATION - ROI FRAMEWORK

### The 3-Minute ROI Pitch

**Opening (30 seconds):**
"Based on what you've shared about [specific pain points they mentioned], let me show you how SuperPatch can deliver measurable value to [Company Name]."

**Problem Recap (30 seconds):**
"You mentioned that [absenteeism/rising costs/employee burnout/etc.] is a significant challenge. You're not alone - Canadian businesses lose an average of 9.3 days per employee per year to illness and health issues. That's costing you approximately $3,300 per employee annually in lost productivity."

**Solution (60 seconds):**
"SuperPatch is a comprehensive, drug-free wellness solution that addresses the root causes of absenteeism and lost productivity: poor sleep, pain, and stress.

Here's how it works: Our Vibrotactile Technology uses specialized patterns on a patch that interact with the body's natural neural pathways. Employees simply apply the patch and go about their day - no appointments, no pills, no side effects.

The result? Employees sleep better, feel less pain, handle stress better, and show up to work ready to perform. Unlike traditional wellness programs with 10-20% engagement, we see 60%+ of employees actively using SuperPatch because it's simple and it works."

**ROI (60 seconds):**
"Let me share what this means for your bottom line:

For a company with [X] employees like yours:
- **Absenteeism:** A 25% reduction in sick days could save you [$X] annually
- **Productivity:** Even a 15% improvement in presenteeism is worth [$X]
- **Pharmaceutical costs:** A 30% reduction in sleep, pain, and stress medications saves [$X]
- **Retention:** Reducing turnover by just 5% saves [$X] in replacement costs

Companies are seeing a 3-5x return on their SuperPatch investment. And unlike complex wellness programs, this requires almost zero administrative time from you."

**Close:**
"Does this sound like something that could help [Company Name]? I'd love to discuss how we could structure a program for your team."

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

**Framework:** Acknowledge → Validate → Redirect with Question → Provide Value

---

### Budget and Cost Objections

#### "We don't have budget for this."

**Response:**
"I completely understand - every expense needs to be justified. Let me ask you this: what is absenteeism currently costing you? 

[If they don't know] Most Canadian businesses spend about $3,300 per employee per year on sick days and reduced productivity. For a company your size, that's potentially [$X]. 

SuperPatch typically delivers a 3-5x return on investment. Would it be worth exploring if we could actually save you money rather than cost you money?"

---

#### "It's too expensive."

**Response:**
"That's fair - cost matters. Can I ask what you're comparing it to?

[Listen]

What I find is that when you look at the total cost of employee health issues - the sick days, the pharmaceutical claims, the lost productivity, the turnover - SuperPatch actually costs less than doing nothing. 

Let me run a quick ROI calculation for your specific situation. What's your current absenteeism rate?"

---

#### "We need to cut costs, not add them."

**Response:**
"That makes total sense, and I wouldn't ask you to add a cost without a clear return. Here's what's interesting: companies are actually using SuperPatch to *reduce* their overall benefits spend.

When employees sleep better and have less pain, they use fewer pharmaceutical benefits. When they're less stressed, they take fewer sick days. The net result is cost savings, not a new expense.

Would you be open to seeing the math on how this could work for your budget?"

---

### Skepticism Objections

#### "Does this really work? It sounds too good to be true."

**Response:**
"I appreciate the skepticism - you should be skeptical of any wellness claim. Here's what I'd say:

First, the technology is based on Nobel Prize-winning research from 2021 on how the body's mechanoreceptors work. This is real science, not hype.

Second, we have peer-reviewed clinical studies showing measurable results - faster sleep onset, pain reduction, stress improvement.

But most importantly, I'm not asking you to take my word for it. What if we started with a small pilot - maybe 20-30 employees - and let you see the results for yourself before making any bigger commitment?"

---

#### "We've tried wellness programs before and they didn't work."

**Response:**
"That's actually really common, and there's a reason for it. Traditional wellness programs require employees to change their behavior - go to the gym, meditate, eat better. That takes time and motivation, so engagement is usually 10-20% at best.

SuperPatch is different. Employees don't have to do anything except put on a patch. It takes 5 seconds. That's why we see 60%+ engagement. And because the technology works immediately - not over weeks or months - employees actually feel the difference and keep using it.

What was the main reason your previous programs failed to get traction?"

---

#### "Our employees won't use it."

**Response:**
"That's a legitimate concern - what good is a wellness program if nobody uses it?

Here's what we've found: the #1 barrier to wellness program adoption is time and effort. SuperPatch removes that barrier entirely. It's a patch you put on in the morning - that's it. No appointments, no classes, no logging into apps.

The other barrier is results. If something works, people keep using it. When employees feel better sleep after the first night or less pain after the first day, they become advocates.

What would make your employees more likely to engage with a wellness program?"

---

### Timing Objections

#### "This isn't the right time."

**Response:**
"I understand timing is everything. Can I ask what would make it the right time?

[Listen]

Here's my thought: employee health issues don't wait for the right time. Every week you wait is another week of sick days, lost productivity, and stressed employees.

What if we structured something that could start small and scale up when timing is better? A pilot program requires minimal commitment but lets you see the value firsthand."

---

#### "We're in the middle of [open enrollment / benefits renewal / restructuring]."

**Response:**
"That actually might be perfect timing. Many companies introduce SuperPatch as part of their benefits refresh - it gives employees something new and valuable to look forward to.

If you're evaluating your benefits program anyway, wouldn't this be the ideal time to consider an addition that could actually reduce your overall costs?

When is your [enrollment period / renewal decision]? We could prepare a proposal for that timeline."

---

#### "Let's revisit this next quarter / next year."

**Response:**
"I'm happy to follow up then. Before we schedule that, let me ask: what would need to change between now and then for this to make sense?

[Listen]

I ask because if employee health is costing you [$X] per month, waiting three months means [$X × 3] in costs you could have avoided. Is there a smaller step we could take now that doesn't require a big commitment?"

---

### Competition Objections

#### "We already have a wellness program."

**Response:**
"That's great - it shows you value employee health. Tell me about your current program - what's working well?

[Listen]

SuperPatch isn't meant to replace what you have. It's designed to complement existing programs by addressing the physical factors - sleep, pain, stress - that often prevent employees from benefiting from other wellness initiatives.

Think about it: if an employee isn't sleeping well, they're not going to have the energy for that gym membership or meditation app. SuperPatch helps create the foundation for everything else to work better.

Would it be worth exploring how this could enhance what you're already doing?"

---

#### "We offer pharmaceutical benefits for these issues."

**Response:**
"Pharmaceutical coverage is important - I'm not suggesting you change that. The challenge is that many employees either don't want to take medications (because of side effects or dependency concerns) or are looking for non-drug alternatives.

SuperPatch gives employees another option - one that's drug-free and has no side effects. And here's the business case: when employees use SuperPatch instead of prescriptions, your pharmaceutical claims go down.

We've seen companies reduce sleep, pain, and stress medication claims by 25-35%. What would that kind of reduction mean for your benefits costs?"

---

#### "What makes you different from [competitor]?"

**Response:**
"Good question - you should absolutely compare options. Here's what sets SuperPatch apart:

1. **Multi-domain solution:** Most wellness solutions address one thing - sleep OR pain OR stress. SuperPatch addresses all of them with different patches, giving you comprehensive coverage.

2. **Zero effort for employees:** No apps to use, no classes to attend, no habits to build. Just put on a patch.

3. **Drug-free technology:** Based on Nobel Prize-winning research. No side effects, no dependency, no drug interactions.

4. **Immediate results:** Employees feel the difference in hours, not weeks. That drives adoption.

What's most important to you in a wellness solution?"

---

### Authority Objections

#### "I need to discuss this with my [CEO / CFO / board]."

**Response:**
"Absolutely - this is an important decision. What information would be most helpful for that conversation?

[Listen]

Let me prepare a business case summary with ROI projections specific to [Company Name]. I can include case studies from similar companies and the key points that typically resonate with [CEOs/CFOs/boards].

Would it be helpful if I joined that conversation to answer any questions, or would you prefer to present it yourself first?"

---

#### "Our benefits are managed by [broker / consultant / Chambers Plan]."

**Response:**
"Perfect - they're an important part of the equation. We actually work with benefits consultants and the Chambers Plan regularly. 

Would it be helpful if I connected with your [broker/consultant] directly to walk them through the program? That way they can evaluate it as part of your overall benefits strategy.

What's the best way to make that introduction?"

---

### Canadian-Specific Objections

#### "Is this approved in Canada?"

**Response:**
"Great question. SuperPatch is a wellness technology, not a pharmaceutical or medical device, so it doesn't require Health Canada drug approval. It's similar to acupressure or other non-invasive wellness products.

That said, our technology is based on peer-reviewed clinical research and Nobel Prize-winning science. We're committed to the highest standards of safety and efficacy.

Would you like me to share the clinical studies for your review?"

---

#### "Do you have Canadian references / case studies?"

**Response:**
"We're building our Canadian presence and working with businesses across the country. While I can share case studies from our broader portfolio, I'd also suggest this: let's create a case study together.

If we pilot SuperPatch at [Company Name] and you see the results we expect, you'd be a reference for other Canadian businesses. And frankly, that's more valuable to you than hearing about someone else - you'd have your own data.

Would a pilot be something you'd consider?"

---

#### "We have employees in Quebec - do you support French?"

**Response:**
"Currently our materials are in English, but the product itself is universal - the patches work regardless of language. We're developing French-language support materials as we expand in Quebec.

For now, we can provide translated summaries of key information. Would that work for your Quebec employees?"

## 7. CLOSING SCRIPTS

### Trial / Pilot Close

**Script:**
"[Name], based on everything we've discussed, it sounds like SuperPatch could deliver real value for [Company Name]. 

Rather than asking you to commit to a full program, what if we started with a pilot? We could select [20-50] employees across different roles, run it for [60-90 days], and measure the actual results in your environment.

That way you can see the impact firsthand before making a bigger decision. How does that sound?"

---

### ROI Close

**Script:**
"Let's look at the numbers we discussed:
- Your absenteeism is costing approximately [$X] per year
- Pharmaceutical claims for sleep, pain, and stress are around [$X]
- Presenteeism is likely [$X] or more

Even conservative improvements in these areas would save you [$X] - that's a [X]x return on a SuperPatch investment.

The question isn't whether you can afford SuperPatch - it's whether you can afford not to address these costs. What do you think is the right next step?"

---

### Competitive Close

**Script:**
"You mentioned that competing for talent is a challenge. Here's the reality: candidates today expect comprehensive wellness benefits. Companies that offer innovative solutions like SuperPatch stand out in the job market.

This isn't just about current employees - it's about every hire you make going forward. What would it mean for your recruiting if you could offer something your competitors don't?"

---

### Timeline Close

**Script:**
"We've talked about the impact poor sleep, pain, and stress are having on your team right now. Every week that continues is another week of sick days, lost productivity, and employees who aren't at their best.

If we start a pilot next month, you could have data within [60-90 days] to make a decision. If we wait until [next quarter/next year], that's [X months] of preventable costs.

What would it take to get started this month?"

---

### Partnership Close (for Chamber Executives)

**Script:**
"[Name], based on our conversation, it sounds like SuperPatch could bring real value to your members while creating a new revenue stream for [Chamber Name].

Here's what I'm proposing:
- Exclusive member pricing not available elsewhere
- [X%] revenue share on all member purchases
- Co-branded marketing and educational materials
- We handle all fulfillment and support

The next step would be to present this to your board. Can we schedule a time for me to walk them through the partnership opportunity?"

---

### Assumptive Close

**Script:**
"It sounds like we're aligned on the value SuperPatch can bring to [Company Name]. The typical next step is to identify a pilot group and set some baseline measurements.

Would you want to start with a specific department, or would it make sense to select employees across different functions to get a broader picture?"

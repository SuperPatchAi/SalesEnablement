## 3. OPENING SCRIPTS

I'm reaching out to practices that work with athletes because we have a drug-free, banned-substance-free performance support patch using VTT technology. For athletes who need clean performance support – whether competitive or recreational – this fills an important gap. Do you work with patients who could benefit?"

### 2. Email Introduction
**Subject:** Clean Performance Support for Your Athletic Patients

"Dr. [Name],

Athletes at every level want performance optimization, but concerns about banned substances, side effects, and supplement quality limit options.

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION (2-Minute)

**[PROBLEM]**
"Athletes want every edge, but the performance supplement market is problematic – contamination risks, banned substance concerns, side effects, and unverifiable claims. For tested athletes, the stakes are career-ending. For recreational athletes, it's about health and safety. Practitioners need clean options they can confidently recommend."

**[SOLUTION]**
"Victory uses Vibrotactile Technology to support athletic performance through neural pathway optimization – not chemical enhancement. Based on Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research, it's completely drug-free with no banned substances, no risk of positive drug tests, and no side effects.

Athletes report improved strength, speed, agility, and recovery. For return-to-sport patients, it provides confidence and support during rehabilitation.

For your practice: clean performance support, 25% practitioner margin, and differentiation with innovative technology. Would you like to trial this with your athletic patients?"

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Performance is about training and nutrition, not gadgets."
**Response:** "Absolutely – training and nutrition are foundational. Victory doesn't replace those; it complements them. By optimizing neural pathways governing motor control and coordination, it helps athletes get more from their training. It's an enhancement tool, not a shortcut."

### "How can this be legal for tested athletes?"
**Response:** "Victory delivers nothing into the body – no substances whatsoever. It works through mechanoreceptor activation affecting neural pathways. There's nothing to test positive for because there are no drugs or supplements involved. It's as clean as wearing compression gear."

### "Athletes need real interventions, not patches."
**Response:** "VTT is a real intervention – it's based on Nobel Prize-winning research on how mechanoreceptors influence neural function. The same science underpins how proprioceptive training, balance work, and neuromuscular activation protocols work. Victory provides continuous neural support using these validated mechanisms."

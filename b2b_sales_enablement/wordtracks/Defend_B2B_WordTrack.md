## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Immune support requires proper nutrition and lifestyle."
**Response:** "Absolutely – and Defend complements those foundations. It's not a replacement for good nutrition, sleep, and exercise; it's an additional layer of support. For patients who are doing the fundamentals, Defend optimizes their body's response. For those who struggle with compliance, it provides consistent support while you work on lifestyle factors."

### "How can a patch support immunity without delivering nutrients?"
**Response:** "VTT works through neural pathway optimization. The nervous system plays a critical role in immune regulation – neuro-immune communication is well-established in the literature. By supporting these neural pathways, Defend helps optimize the body's coordinated immune response. It's a different mechanism than nutrient delivery, but validated by mechanoreceptor research."

### "I already have comprehensive immune protocols."
**Response:** "Defend can integrate with your existing protocols. It doesn't replace what you're doing; it adds another layer of support. And for patients who struggle with the complexity of your full protocol, it provides a simple baseline while you work toward full compliance."

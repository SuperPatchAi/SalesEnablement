MAIN TOPIC & TECHNIQUE\nThe primary sales concept/technique being taught is **Conversation Aikido**.\n\n### 2. KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS\n**Framework/Technique Name:** Conversation Aikido\n\n**Step-by-step process:**\n1.  **Acknowledge and Understand:** When a customer presents an objection or question, respond with \"I understand...\" and repeat in your own words what they are saying or feeling.\n2.  **Redirect with an Open Question:** Follow up by asking an open-ended question that encourages them to elaborate on their underlying needs, issues, or interests.\n\n**The psychology/principle behind why it works:**\n*   **The Brain Model:** The speaker illustrates that when confronted with an objection or a statement that feels like an attack, our \"emotion goes up and thinking goes down.\" Directly answering or refuting their point (\"No, it's not...\") triggers an emotional reaction and shuts down their rational thinking.\n*   **Aikido Principle:** Instead of resisting or countering directly (like in karate), Conversation Aikido leverages the \"energy, the force of the opponent against them.\" By acknowledging and going \"towards the punch,\" you disarm the emotional response.\n*   **Uncovering True Needs:** By asking an open question *after* acknowledging their point, you guide them from an emotional, surface-level statement to revealing their deeper concerns, criteria, or motivations. This allows you to truly understand \"what's the real underlying need, issue, interest of the person that you're listening to.\"\n\n### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS\n*   **General Objection/Question Response Pattern:**\n    *   \"I understand [their point/feeling]. [Open-ended question]?\"\n\n*   **Specific Objection Responses:**\n    *   **Objection:** \"Your product is too expensive.\"\n    *   **Response:** \"I understand that money is an important factor for you. What other criteria will be used in taking this decision?\"\n    *   **Alternative Response (personal context example):** \"I understand you feel frustrated,\" or \"I understand you feel let down.\" (The speaker notes this requires practice to find words that \"captures what the other person feels.\")\n    *   **Objection:** \"I'll have to speak to my boss.\"\n    *   **Response:** \"Hey, this is an important decision, I understand you want to get everyone involved. What other things are going on?\" (The speaker initially suggests \"When can I come and meet with you and your boss together?\" but then implicitly reframes it to a more open-ended question to align with the core principle.)\n\n### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING\n*   **Common Objections Mentioned:**\n    *   \"Your product is too expensive.\"\n    *   \"You're always late.\" (Personal context, for illustrative purposes)\n    *   \"You never wash the dishes.\" (Personal context, for illustrative purposes)\n    *   \"I'll have to speak to my boss.\"\n    *   \"Your competitor is better.\"\n    *   \"You failed us three years ago.\"\n    *   \"I don't trust your company.\"\n\n*   **Recommended Responses:** (See Section 3 for exact wording) The core recommended response is \"I understand [their objection/feeling]. [Open-ended question to uncover underlying issues]?\"\n\n*   **The reframe or psychology behind each response:**\n    *   The goal is to avoid directly refuting or defending. Instead, validate their perspective/emotion and then shift the conversation to their underlying criteria, needs, or decision-making process. This prevents immediate defensiveness and opens a path to deeper understanding.\n\n### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS\n1.  **Avoid Direct Answers to Objections:** Directly answering a question or refuting an objection triggers emotional responses and shuts down rational thought, preventing you from understanding the *real* issue.\n2.  **Practice \"Conversation Aikido\":** Master the two-step process: (1) \"I understand...\" followed by a restatement of their point/feeling, and (2) an open-ended question that seeks to uncover deeper needs, interests, or criteria.\n3.  **Focus on Understanding the \"Why\":** The customer's initial statement (e.g., \"too expensive\") is rarely the *real* issue. Your role is to understand what's truly behind their reasoning.\n4.  **Harness Emotional Energy:** Instead of confronting, \"go towards the punch.\" Acknowledge their emotion or objection to diffuse tension and allow them to think more clearly.\n5.  **Repetition is Key:** The speaker emphasizes that years of schooling have trained us to answer questions. It will take \"at least 18 years to get out of the habit\" of directly answering, so consistent practice of \"I understand\" and open questions is crucial.\n\n### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION\nHere\u2019s how Conversation Aikido can be specifically applied to selling Super Patch wellness products in a direct sales/network marketing context:\n\n1.  **Objection: \"Super Patches are too expensive.\"**\n    *   **Aikido Response:** \"I understand that price is an important factor when you're considering new wellness solutions. What aspects are most important for you in a product like this, beyond just the initial cost?\"\n    *   **Psychology:** Validates their financial concern while shifting the focus to value, benefits, and their personal health priorities.\n\n2.  **Objection: \"Do these Super Patches really work? It sounds too good to be true.\"**\n    *   **Aikido Response:** \"I completely understand why you might be skeptical about new technologies, and it's important to feel confident in your choices. What would you need to see, hear, or experience to truly feel that this is a credible solution for you?\"\n    *   **Psychology:** Acknowledges their skepticism without being defensive, and empowers them to define their own path to belief, which could involve testimonials, scientific explanations, or a trial.\n\n3.  **Objection: \"I'm already using [another pain relief cream/supplement] for my [pain/sleep/energy].\"**\n    *   **Aikido Response:** \"That's great you've found something that helps, and I understand you have an existing routine. What do you like most about your current approach, and what, if anything, do you feel it might still be missing or could be improved upon?\"\n    *   **Psychology:** Respects their current solution and opens a non-confrontational dialogue about potential unmet needs or areas where Super Patch might offer additional benefits without requiring them to abandon their current product.\n\n4.  **Objection: \"I need to think about it / talk to my spouse.\"**\n    *   **Aikido Response:** \"I understand this is a significant decision for your health and well-being, and you want to ensure it's the right fit for your lifestyle. What specific questions or considerations would be most helpful for you and your spouse to discuss as you evaluate the Super Patch?\"\n    *   **Psychology:** Validates their need for careful consideration and partner involvement. It helps identify precise sticking points or information gaps, allowing you to provide targeted support or clarification.\n\n5.  **Objection: \"How long until I see results from the Super Patch?\"**\n    *   **Aikido Response:** \"I understand you're eager to experience the benefits, and that's totally natural. What kind of results are you hoping for, and how quickly would you ideally like to start feeling a difference?\"\n    *   **Psychology:** Acknowledges their desire for results and helps clarify their expectations, allowing you to tailor your explanation of typical timelines and individual variability."

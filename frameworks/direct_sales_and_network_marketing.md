## The Secret to Direct Sales Success (It's not selling!)

**Source:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quAd1lzUgA0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quAd1lzUgA0)

This video emphasizes a relationship-first approach to direct sales, moving away from traditional "selling" and towards genuine connection. The core idea is to build a large network of relationships through consistent, non-salesy interactions, which will eventually lead to business opportunities.

## VIDEO ANALYSIS

### 1. MAIN TOPIC & TECHNIQUE
The primary sales concept/technique being taught is **Relationship-Driven Connection and Growth (The 3+3+3=3000 Model)**. The secret to direct sales success, according to the speaker, "is not selling!" but rather connecting with people.

### 2. KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

**A. The 3+3+3=3000 Model**
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  **Connect with 3 current customers daily.**
    2.  **Connect with 3 potential customers daily.**
    3.  **Connect with 3 people you would love to join your team daily.**
    *   *(Note: The speaker mentions taking a day off here and there is fine, but consistency is key.)*
*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:** This method focuses on intentionally building genuine relationships without pushing products or business opportunities immediately. By consistently engaging with people on a personal level, you build trust, rapport, and a strong network. This consistent effort, totaling 9 connections per day (or 3000+ connections per year), creates exponential growth in your business by nurturing relationships that will naturally lead to sales and recruitment when the time is right. It prevents feeling "gross" or "spammy" and instead fosters authentic engagement.

**B. The List of 100 (Prerequisite/Supporting Framework)**
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  Create a list of at least 100 people you know in your business (current customers, potential customers, potential teammates).
    2.  Continuously grow and expand this list by meeting new people at pop-up events, parties, playgrounds, etc.
*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:** This list serves as your "network" or "circle" of people to consistently apply the 3+3+3=3000 model to. By having a growing list, you ensure you always have people to connect with, preventing stagnation in your outreach and business growth. The list evolves as your network grows.

**C. Weekly Connection Mapping**
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  Take your "List of 100."
    2.  Map out your week (Monday through Sunday).
    3.  Write down exactly who you are going to connect with each day (following the 3+3+3=3000 model).
*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:** This brings intentionality and structure to your daily connection efforts. By planning who you'll connect with, you ensure consistency, prevent procrastination, and maintain a strategic approach to relationship building, which in turn drives exponential growth.

### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS

*   **Key Principle:** "You're not gonna talk shop every day. You're not gonna be pushing your product on them every day. You're not gonna be telling them about your business every day. You are simply connecting with them."
*   **Discovery questions (implicit):** "asking questions, getting to know them as a person."
*   **Opening lines / Connection Phrases (examples):**
    *   *Relating/Empathizing:* "Hey mama, I saw your post on Instagram, it looks like you've had a rough week. I have too."
    *   *Sharing Common Interest/Value:* "Hey, I saw you got an Instapot. I have one too, I love mine. Here's my favorite recipe I thought you might like."
*   **Follow-up messages (for business conversations):** The speaker mentions her "perfectly crafted DMs, PMs, and texts" as a resource for when you *do* start having business conversations, implying these are pre-written, non-spammy scripts to transition naturally.

### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING

*   **Implicit Objection:** Salespeople might feel "gross," "spammy," or awkward when trying to introduce their products or business opportunities.
*   **Recommended Responses (Reframe/Psychology):** The speaker's entire strategy is designed to *prevent* this objection by prioritizing genuine connection first.
    *   "We don't want everything to be all about business, but when we do, we want to make sure it's not gross, it's not spammy, it's not like out of the blue where the person is like, 'Where did this come from? What is she talking about? This is getting really awkward and I don't know if I want to continue this conversation.'"
    *   The reframe is that by connecting authentically and getting to know people "as a person," you build a foundation where "the time will come to introduce your business, introduce your products, and kind of take that relationship down that path" naturally and without awkwardness.

### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1.  **Focus on Relationships, Not Selling:** The core secret to direct sales success is building genuine, one-on-one relationships, not pushing products daily.
2.  **Implement the 3+3+3=3000 Model:** Consistently connect with 3 current customers, 3 potential customers, and 3 potential teammates every day (or most days) to generate over 3000 connections annually.
3.  **Connect Authentically:** Engage in conversational ways, ask questions, relate to their lives, and share personal experiences without immediately talking about your business or products.
4.  **Strategic Planning:** Use a "List of 100" and map out your weekly connections to ensure intentional and consistent outreach.
5.  **Timing is Everything:** Trust that as genuine relationships develop, natural opportunities to introduce your Super Patch products and business will arise, making the conversation feel natural and welcome rather than spammy.

### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION

Here's how these techniques can be specifically applied to selling Super Patch wellness products in a direct sales/network marketing context:

*   **General Approach for Super Patch:** Instead of starting with "Have you heard of Super Patch?" or "Buy my patches!", start with genuine curiosity about people's well-being, daily lives, or challenges.

*   **Applying the 3+3+3 Model:**

    *   **3 Current Super Patch Customers (Daily Check-ins):**
        *   **Script Example (Relating to their experience):** "Hey [Customer Name]! Just thinking of you. How have you been feeling with the [specific Super Patch] you got last month? I hope it's still bringing you that relief from [pain area/sleep issue/energy dip]!"
        *   **Script Example (Adding Value):** "Hi [Customer Name]! Hope you're having a great week. I saw [another customer/friend] post about struggling with travel fatigue, and it reminded me of how much my [specific Super Patch, e.g., energy patch] helps me on trips. Have you ever tried [suggesting another patch for a common complementary need]?"
        *   **Psychology:** Shows you care beyond the sale, encourages continued use, and opens the door for referrals or additional product interest without direct selling.

    *   **3 Potential Super Patch Customers (Building Bridges):**
        *   **Script Example (Empathizing with a shared struggle):** "Hey [Potential Customer Name], I saw your post about dealing with [specific problem like restless nights/back pain/stress]. I totally get that; I used to struggle with [same problem] too. What have you found helps you the most?" (Focus on their experience, not your solution yet).
        *   **Script Example (Finding common ground):** "Hi [Potential Customer Name]! Your [activity, e.g., running, gardening, busy mom life] looks so inspiring! How do you keep your energy up/manage recovery? I'm always looking for tips on [relevant wellness goal]." (Opens the door for them to mention pain/fatigue, allowing you to organically share your experience with Super Patch later).
        *   **Psychology:** Gathers information about their needs/struggles, builds rapport, and positions you as someone who understands and potentially has solutions, without being pushy. The patch will be a natural introduction later.

    *   **3 Potential Super Patch Teammates (Empowering Conversations):**
        *   **Script Example (Acknowledging success and hinting at opportunity):** "Hey [Potential Teammate Name], I'm so impressed with how you manage [career/family/hustle]! You've got such a great work ethic. I often connect with driven people who are looking for a way to add extra income or flexibility around their busy lives. Have you ever considered a side gig that aligns with wellness?"
        *   **Script Example (Relating to passion/values):** "Hi [Potential Teammate Name]! I love your passion for [health/community/helping others]. I'm part of a community of women who are really focused on [wellness/financial freedom], and your values really align with what we do. No pressure at all, but I thought of you because of that. What do you enjoy most about [their current work/passion]?"
        *   **Psychology:** Recognizes their strengths, aligns with their aspirations, and gently introduces the possibility of a business partnership, framing it as an extension of their existing passions or needs, not just a recruitment pitch.

*   **Avoiding "Gross" or "Spammy" Interactions:**
    *   **Instead of:** "You HAVE to try this pain relief patch! It's changed my life!"
    *   **Try:** Engage in a conversation about their pain, listen actively, share your personal experience with a patch (e.g., "I know what you mean about that persistent knee pain; I found something that really helped me, but it's a bit outside the box. If you're open to hearing about it, I'd be happy to share my story."), then offer information if they show interest.

*   **List of 100 for Super Patch:**
    *   Your list should include anyone who might benefit from pain relief, better sleep, increased energy, focus, balance, or reducing stress – which is almost everyone!
    *   Consider parents, athletes, older adults, people with demanding jobs, those recovering from injuries, etc. Continuously add new contacts from wellness events, community groups, or daily interactions.

*   **Weekly Connection Mapping for Super Patch:**
    *   Plan specific individuals for each "3" category. For instance, on Monday, connect with Customer A about their sleep, Potential Customer B about their gym routine, and Potential Teammate C about their entrepreneurial spirit. This ensures you consistently nurture relationships across all vital areas of your business.

## Direct Selling Tips and Tricks

**Source:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzdGWfpuOq4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzdGWfpuOq4)

Here's a structured analysis of the sales training video, designed for a direct sales team, with specific application to Super Patch wellness products:

## VIDEO ANALYSIS

### 1. MAIN TOPIC & TECHNIQUE
The primary sales concept being taught revolves around **Strategic Communication and Influence in Direct Sales**. This includes techniques for maintaining a positive mindset, tailoring information delivery, and creating effective urgency to close sales.

### 2. KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

**Framework 1: Managing External Negativity and Maintaining Positivity**
*   **Framework/Technique Name:** The "I Guess We'll See" Response
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  **Identify Criticism:** When someone (a prospect, friend, family member) starts to "poke holes" in what you do, expresses negativity about direct selling, or pulls your business/you to pieces.
    2.  **Employ the Phrase:** Respond calmly and confidently with the exact phrase "I guess we'll see."
    3.  **Smile:** Accompany the phrase with a nice big smile.
    4.  **Disengage:** Walk away with your head held high, without engaging in an argument or feeling the need to defend yourself.
*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:** This response does not give away your energy or power to the critic. It prevents you from getting drawn into a "worrisome dance" or passive-aggressive argument. While the critic may not like it, they will definitely respect you for not being pulled into their negativity. It allows you to maintain your composure and confidence.

**Framework 2: Tailoring Information with Specific Sales Funnels**
*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Dual Sales Funnels (Product-Specific & Business-Specific)
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  **Recognize Dual Objectives:** Understand that in direct sales, prospects typically have one of two main interests: either just the product, or the business opportunity (becoming a representative).
    2.  **Initial Qualification Question:** In the initial stages of communication, ask a quick question to identify their primary interest.
    3.  **Direct to Appropriate Funnel:** Based on their answer, guide them through either a product-specific communication process (funnel) or a business-specific communication process (funnel).
    4.  **Provide Tailored Information:** Only provide information relevant to their stated interest. Avoid overwhelming them with unnecessary details from the other side of the business.
*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:** This approach prevents "information overload" which can cause prospects to question their interest or feel overwhelmed, ultimately pushing them away. By letting the prospect lead and providing only the information they need with an "open mind," you increase engagement and the likelihood of a sale or recruitment.

**Framework 3: Leveraging Urgency Bonuses for Conversions**
*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Genuine Urgency Bonus
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  **Create a Value-Adding Bonus:** Develop a bonus that genuinely enhances or helps achieve the result the prospect is looking for (either product benefits or business success). It should be a "lock-and-key" fit with the main offer.
    2.  **Hold Back the Bonus:** Don't reveal the bonus upfront.
    3.  **Identify Hesitation:** When a prospect expresses hesitation (e.g., "I'm not so sure," "I may get back to you").
    4.  **Offer the Bonus with a Call to Action:** Present the bonus using a specific closing phrase that highlights the immediate benefit of taking action.
    5.  **Explain the "Why Now":** Clearly show why acting *now* (with the bonus) makes the deal a "great deal right now," versus just a "good deal" later without the bonus.
*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:** This creates a sense of immediate value and incentive, moving prospects "off the fence." It addresses the natural human tendency to procrastinate by adding an extra, time-sensitive benefit that is directly relevant to their goals, thus encouraging a quicker decision.

### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS

*   **Objection Response (for negativity/criticism):**
    > "I guess we'll see." (0:17)
    > *(Accompany with a nice big smile.)*

*   **Discovery Question (for funneling prospects):**
    > "What interests you the most? The making money side, the business side, being your own representative, or the product? Do you just want to be a customer?" (3:22-3:29)

*   **Closing Phrase (for presenting urgency bonus):**
    > "Listen, this will always be a good deal, but would you like me to show you why this is a great deal right now?" (4:43-4:49)

### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING

*   **Common Objection:** Negativity or criticism towards direct sales/your product/opportunity (e.g., "It's a scam," "Those things never work").
    *   **Recommended Response:** "I guess we'll see."
    *   **Reframe/Psychology:** This response avoids confrontation, maintaining your positive energy and professionalism. It subtly challenges the critic to prove their point with your future success, without you needing to argue. It commands respect by not allowing them to derail your confidence.

*   **Common Objection:** Indecision or procrastination (e.g., "I need to think about it," "I'll get back to you," "I'm not so sure").
    *   **Recommended Response:** "Listen, this will always be a good deal, but would you like me to show you why this is a great deal right now?"
    *   **Reframe/Psychology:** This acknowledges their statement but immediately pivots to creating a positive, time-sensitive reason to act. It shifts focus from their doubt to an exclusive, immediate benefit they would miss out on if they delay, effectively moving them off the fence.

### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1.  **Maintain Your Emotional State:** Don't engage in arguments or debates with critics. Use the "I guess we'll see" phrase to maintain your power and positivity.
2.  **Tailor Your Approach:** Use a simple discovery question to determine if a prospect is interested in the product or the business, then provide only relevant information via specific "funnels" (online or face-to-face steps).
3.  **Create Genuine Urgency:** Develop a valuable, relevant bonus that enhances the product or business outcome. Use a specific closing question to present this bonus and motivate immediate action.
4.  **Focus on Specificity:** Avoid overwhelming prospects with all information. Give them exactly what they need based on their stated interest.
5.  **Apply What You Learn:** Theoretical knowledge is useless without application. Immediately implement these tips in your daily sales activities.

### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION

Here's how these techniques can be specifically applied to selling Super Patch wellness products:

**1. Handling Negativity / Skepticism about Super Patch:**
*   **Scenario:** A prospect says, "Oh, those patches? They sound like snake oil, I don't believe in that kind of stuff." or "I've tried similar things, they never work."
*   **Super Patch Script:** "I understand why you might think that, and it's important to be skeptical. All I can say is, it's been a game-changer for many people, including myself. I guess we'll see." *(with a smile)*
*   **Psychology in Action:** This acknowledges their skepticism without validating it. It subtly suggests that their current belief might be limiting, and that the proof will be in the pudding. By confidently saying "I guess we'll see," you invite them to observe the results for others (or eventually themselves) without needing to engage in a fruitless debate.

**2. Utilizing Dual Sales Funnels for Super Patch:**
*   **Scenario:** You've just connected with someone new and want to see if they're a potential customer or a potential business builder.
*   **Super Patch Discovery Question:** "Based on what you've heard about Super Patch, are you more interested in exploring how the patches could help you personally with things like pain relief, better sleep, or energy? Or are you also curious about the opportunity to earn income by sharing these amazing products with others?"
*   **Product-Specific Funnel Example (for customers):**
    *   If they choose product: Focus on testimonials, scientific backing (like the specific neuro-tech), different patch types (e.g., REM for sleep, Freedom for pain), and how to choose the right patch. Perhaps a link to a product overview page or a specific product bundle.
    *   **Application:** "Great! Many people start with the [specific patch, e.g., Freedom] for common discomfort. Would you like me to send you a quick video showcasing how it works and some success stories?"
*   **Business-Specific Funnel Example (for reps):**
    *   If they choose business: Focus on the compensation plan, the support system, training, market opportunity, and how they can get their own products for free quickly. Perhaps a link to an income potential webinar or a business starter kit overview.
    *   **Application:** "Fantastic! Building a Super Patch business is incredibly rewarding. I can share some info on how you can get started, potentially earn a significant income, and even get your own patches for free. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to outline the possibilities?"

**3. Creating an Urgency Bonus for Super Patch:**
*   **Scenario:** A prospect is interested but says, "I really like the idea of Super Patch, but I need to save up/think about it/research more before buying."
*   **Super Patch Urgency Bonus Idea:**
    *   **For Customers:** Offer a free *Personalized Wellness Plan* (a simple guide on which patches to use for their specific needs, how to apply them for maximum benefit, and a daily routine) or a *Bonus Sample Pack* of a different patch type (e.g., if they buy pain patches, offer a sample sleep patch).
    *   **For Potential Reps:** Offer a *1-on-1 Fast Start Coaching Session* with you (worth X value) or a *Done-For-You Social Media Content Pack* for their first week.
*   **Super Patch Closing Phrase with Urgency:**
    *   **For Customers:** "I totally get that! The patches will always be available, but would you like me to show you why getting started today is a great deal right now? If you decide to purchase your [specific patch/bundle] today, I'd love to put together a personalized Super Patch wellness plan for your specific goals, completely free, to ensure you get the absolute best results from day one. That's something I typically reserve for my VIP clients."
    *   **For Potential Reps:** "Absolutely, it's a big decision. This is always a great business, but would you like me to show you why launching your Super Patch business today is an incredible opportunity? If you decide to join our team in the next 24 hours, I'll personally provide you with a 'Quick Start Guide to Your First 3 Sales' bonus. This includes proven scripts and strategies to help you get your investment back and generate immediate income. That bonus is specifically designed for fast action-takers."

By implementing these strategies, your direct sales team can better manage challenges, optimize their outreach, and effectively convert prospects into loyal Super Patch customers and thriving business partners.

## Network Marketing Explained

**Source:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzOgum0ybNM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzOgum0ybNM)

## VIDEO ANALYSIS

### 1. MAIN TOPIC & TECHNIQUE
The primary sales concept taught is **Relationship-Based Network Marketing**, focusing on building genuine connections and offering solutions rather than aggressively selling.

### 2. KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

**A. Network Marketing Redefined**
*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Network Marketing = Network + Marketing (Relationship Marketing focus)
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  **Build a "Network":** Connect with people based on shared interests or needs. Understand that "your network is your net worth." (02:09)
    2.  **"Market" effectively:** Learn to get your content in front of the right people, primarily through social media. (02:41)
    3.  **Combine Network + Marketing:** Build a network of people who can market a product, service, offer, or opportunity, creating a "big network marketing empire." (03:04)
*   **Psychology/Principle:** Network marketing companies reward distributors for customer care and direct sales, rather than spending on traditional advertising. This fosters a personal connection and direct support for customers, which is crucial for "transformational products" like skincare, health, and travel. (04:44)

**B. The "Are You Open?" Invitation**
*   **Framework/Technique Name:** The "Are You Open?" Approach
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  **Avoid direct selling:** Do not lead with a hard sell to friends and family. (08:08)
    2.  **Ask for support instead:** Approach contacts by saying, "I've got started in this online business. I'm super excited about it. I would absolutely love if you could support me on my journey. Are you open to that?" (08:51)
    3.  **Offer a trial/event (optional):** Suggest they "come to my launch event?" or "trial my product for 30 days and give you a testimonial?" (09:08)
    4.  **Gauge openness:** Simply determine if someone is "open" to what you have to offer. (10:20)
    5.  **Respect their decision:** "If they're not open, you can't close them." If they say no, "Okay, cool, I'll go find someone who is open." (10:29)
*   **Psychology/Principle:** This approach avoids offending people and shifts the focus from selling to seeking support or simply identifying genuine interest. It respects boundaries and prevents the negative perception often associated with aggressive network marketing. "Clarity" is more important than "motivation" for long-term consistency. (10:55, 16:08)

**C. Building a Personal Brand & Activity-Based Goal Setting**
*   **Framework/Technique Name:** The "I Help" Statement & Activity-Driven Goals
*   **Step-by-step process (Personal Brand):**
    1.  **Identify who you help:** Be clear about your target audience.
    2.  **Identify what you help them with:** Define the specific problem you solve or benefit you provide.
    3.  **Create an "I help" statement:** Use the format "I help [who] to [what] with [how/system]." (14:00)
        *   *Example progression:* "I help men to lose weight." -> "I help married men to lose weight." -> "I help married men to lose weight with our secret system." (14:07)
*   **Step-by-step process (Goal Setting):**
    1.  **Set long-term goals:** Establish a 10-year, 5-year, 3-year, 2-year, 1-year, and first 3-month goal. (12:41)
    2.  **Base goals on activity, not just results:** Focus on daily/weekly actions you can control. (13:01)
    3.  **Implement a Weekly Method of Operation (WMO):**
        *   Check in with your mentor daily/weekly.
        *   Submit your numbers (activity metrics) to your mentor.
        *   Share your "win of the week."
        *   Catch up on any missed work.
        *   Plan for future events/activities. (14:43)
*   **Psychology/Principle:** A clear "I help" statement allows potential customers/recruits to self-identify and relate to you, making attraction easier. Activity-based goals provide daily wins and build momentum ("winning streak"), which fuels motivation and consistency, rather than relying solely on outcomes that may take time. Building a personal brand helps "turn strangers to friends." (13:35, 14:22, 19:57)

### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS

*   **Initial Approach (Seeking Support):**
    *   "Hey [Name], I've got started in this online business. I'm super excited about it. I would absolutely love if you could support me on my journey. Are you open to that?" (08:51)
*   **Offers after "openness" is confirmed:**
    *   "Come to my launch event?" (09:08)
    *   "Trial my product for 30 days and give you a testimonial?" (09:11)
*   **"I Help" Statement Template:**
    *   "I help [who] to [what] with [how/system]." (14:04)
    *   *Example 1:* "I help men to lose weight." (14:07)
    *   *Example 2:* "I help married men to lose weight with our secret system." (14:16)
*   **Response to "Are you open?" (If interested):**
    *   "Yes, I am, great, here's the information." (10:59)
*   **Response to "Are you open?" (If not interested):**
    *   "No, I'm not, leave me alone. Okay, cool, I'll go find someone who is open." (11:00)

### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING

*   **Common Objection:** "It's a pyramid thing." / "Network marketing is where all the people at the top make all the money." (17:54)
*   **Recommended Response (Socratic Method / Reframe):**
    1.  "Hey [Name], please explain to me why [you think it's a pyramid thing]?" (18:03)
    2.  "Do you have a job?" (Yes)
    3.  "Does your job have a boss?" (Yes)
    4.  "Does your boss have a boss?" (Yes)
    5.  "Does your boss's boss have a boss?" (Yes)
    6.  "Does your boss make more money than you?" (Yes)
    7.  "Does your boss's boss make more money than your boss?" (Yes)
    8.  "Then doesn't the person towards the top in your job make all the money?" (Yes)
    9.  "So then isn't your job a pyramid thing?" (18:13-18:38)
*   **Reframe/Psychology:** This reframe demonstrates that hierarchical structures (pyramids) exist in many legitimate organizations, including traditional jobs. It shifts the conversation from a loaded term to a functional comparison, highlighting that a "pyramid" structure itself isn't inherently illegal or illegitimate, especially if the end-user receives a genuine benefit. (18:40)

### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1.  **Focus on Relationships, Not Just Sales:** Shift from "network marketing" to "relationship marketing" by genuinely connecting with people and supporting them, rather than just trying to sell.
2.  **Ask for Support, Not Just a Sale:** When approaching friends and family, frame your request as seeking support for your new venture, offering a product trial, or inviting them to learn more, rather than a hard sell.
3.  **Prioritize Activity-Based Goals & Consistency:** Set clear, actionable daily/weekly goals (e.g., reaching out to X new people, creating Y content) that you can control, as consistency in activity leads to momentum and long-term success.
4.  **Build a Personal Brand with a Clear "I Help" Statement:** Define your target audience and the specific problem you solve ("I help [who] to [what] with [how]") to attract interested prospects authentically.
5.  **Overcome Challenges with Clarity and Alternative Thinking:** Identify specific challenges and seek guidance/clarity. When faced with resistance (e.g., "pyramid scheme"), use logical questions to reframe common misconceptions.

### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION

Applying these techniques to selling Super Patch wellness products (e.g., for pain relief, energy, sleep, weight management, focus, balance):

1.  **Relationship Marketing with Super Patch:**
    *   Instead of: "Hey, buy these patches, they'll fix your sleep!"
    *   Try: "Hi [Name], I've been really focused on helping people improve their sleep naturally, and I've started working with a company that offers a unique patch technology. I'm really passionate about it. I'd love your support on this journey. Are you open to hearing a bit more about how it works, or perhaps even trying a sample patch for free to see if it helps you?" (Using the "Are you open?" and "trial for free" scripts).
    *   **Context:** People buy wellness solutions when they trust the person recommending them and feel understood. This approach builds trust.

2.  **"I Help" Statement for Super Patch:**
    *   Instead of: "I sell Super Patches."
    *   Try: "I help busy parents who struggle with chronic back pain to find natural, drug-free relief so they can play with their kids again without discomfort." (For a pain relief patch)
    *   Try: "I help entrepreneurs who feel burnt out and lack focus to regain their energy and clarity naturally, without relying on caffeine or stimulants." (For energy/focus patches)
    *   **Context:** This clearly defines your niche and value proposition, making it easier for ideal prospects to identify you as a solution provider.

3.  **Activity-Based Goals with Super Patch:**
    *   Instead of: "My goal is to sign up 10 new customers this month." (Results-based)
    *   Try: "My daily activity goal is to reach out to 5 new people on social media who express interest in natural pain relief, share one testimonial video, and follow up with 3 existing customers." (Activity-based, for pain relief patches).
    *   **Context:** This provides tangible actions you can take daily, leading to consistent effort and eventual results. You control your activity, not directly the outcome.

4.  **Social Media Lead Generation for Super Patch:**
    *   Instead of: Spamming product links.
    *   Try: Join Facebook groups for "chronic pain support," "insomnia remedies," or "natural energy solutions." Engage in conversations, provide value, and then use the "Are you open?" approach to privately offer a solution.
    *   Try: Post a YouTube video reviewing a Super Patch product, and in the comments, interact with those who inquire. Ask, "Would you be open to trying a sample patch to see if it helps you?"
    *   **Context:** This leverages platforms where people are already discussing their wellness challenges, allowing for targeted outreach and lead generation based on genuine interest.

5.  **Objection Handling (Pyramid Scheme) for Super Patch:**
    *   When someone says: "Is this one of those pyramid things where only people at the top make money?"
    *   Try the reframe: "That's a fair question, and it's important to understand how compensation works. You know, many successful companies, even traditional ones like [mention a well-known company/your own job's structure], have a hierarchical structure where people who take on more responsibility or build larger teams tend to earn more. What's different here is that everyone has an equal opportunity to build their own business and earn income directly based on the products they sell and the customer base they build. The focus is on getting truly transformative products into the hands of people who need them. What specifically makes you ask if it's a pyramid thing?" (Using the Socratic method and re-emphasizing product benefit and individual opportunity).
    *   **Context:** Addresses the common misconception directly by comparing it to familiar structures and emphasizing the product's value and the merit-based compensation structure of legitimate direct selling.

## Network Marketing Mindset Training

## VIDEO ANALYSIS

### 1. MAIN TOPIC & TECHNIQUE
The primary sales concept/technique being taught is **Mindset Shifts for Enhanced Performance in Network Marketing**. The speaker emphasizes that while tactical improvements are important, internal mindset adjustments were crucial for his success, leading to better action and results.

### 2. KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

**Framework 1: Outcome-Oriented Action Focus**
*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Setting Outcome & Focusing on Controllable Actions
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  **Define Desired Outcome:** Clearly identify the results you want to achieve (e.g., specific number of enrollments, rank advancement).
    2.  **Develop an Action Plan:** Create a concrete, daily plan of actions designed to achieve that outcome.
    3.  **Focus on Daily Actions:** Concentrate your mental energy solely on performing these daily actions, rather than the distant outcome.
    4.  **Trust the Process:** Maintain confidence that consistently executing the right actions will eventually lead to the desired results.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** This works by shifting from a "results-driven pressure" mindset (which can be crushing, especially during initial failures) to an "action-driven confidence" mindset. By focusing on what you *can control* (your daily activities) rather than what you *cannot directly control* (immediate results or external reactions), you reduce frustration, build confidence, and sustain motivation. The speaker notes, "Instead of it being, 'oh, it's another day I haven't sponsored somebody,' it's 'it's another day I did the right actions, I'm going to get results soon.'"

**Framework 2: Detachment from External Approval**
*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Detaching from Approval
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  **Acknowledge the Natural Desire for Approval:** Understand that wanting others to be proud or pleased with you is human.
    2.  **Recognize the Nature of Network Marketing:** Accept that direct sales/network marketing is "a tough game" and external validation might be scarce or inconsistent.
    3.  **Cultivate Internal Approval:** Prioritize your own satisfaction and belief in your product, tactics, and the life you're building. Ask: "Do you feel good about what you're doing? Are you happy with the product that you're selling? Are you happy with the tactics that you're following? Do you feel good about the life that you're trying to build and that you're on the right path?"
    4.  **Resist "Looking Successful":** Avoid the trap of trying to *appear* successful on social media or to others if it means being dishonest with yourself.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** This principle addresses the psychological need for acceptance and validation. By becoming internally validated, you build resilience against negativity and rejection, which are common in sales. The speaker warns against "crushing negativity" that comes from constantly seeking external approval. If you are happy with your efforts and direction, external opinions become less impactful, allowing for greater perseverance and authentic behavior.

**Framework 3: Focus on Success, Not Just Being "Successful"**
*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Embracing the Journey of Success
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  **Define Personal Success:** Determine what "feeling successful" means to *you* on a day-to-day basis, beyond just achieving ranks or sales. This involves enjoying the process and being aligned with your values.
    2.  **Reject Superficial Success:** Disengage from the "social media world of what can I post today that makes me look good" and the pressure to constantly present an image of thriving, even when you're not.
    3.  **Be Optimistically Realistic:** Maintain a positive outlook while acknowledging the challenges and realities of building a business. "Be optimistically realistic."
    4.  **Build a Business You Enjoy:** If aspects of your business (like making cold calls or working with certain people) make you miserable, adjust your approach or team.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** This framework encourages a holistic view of success that includes process and personal well-being. It prevents burnout and maintains long-term engagement by ensuring that the daily activities are intrinsically rewarding or at least tolerable, rather than solely driven by external markers of achievement. The idea is that "the future is just a series of now moments," so present happiness is crucial for future success.

**Framework 4: Admit Mistakes and Learn (Growth Mindset)**
*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Admitting and Learning from Mistakes
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  **Acknowledge Mistakes:** Be brave enough to admit when something didn't work as expected. "That was my mistake."
    2.  **Analyze and Understand:** Identify what went wrong and why. "I understand what I did wrong."
    3.  **Formulate Solutions:** Determine how to fix or improve your approach. "Now this is how I'm going to fix it."
    4.  **Embrace Flexibility and Openness:** Be open to new approaches and training, even if it comes from outside your immediate team or company.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** This promotes a growth mindset over a fixed mindset. By viewing failures as learning opportunities rather than personal shortcomings, individuals can adapt, improve, and grow quicker. The speaker highlights his own "stubborn self" and how being open to external training led to a "big breakthrough." "Whoever fails forward the quickest is the one that reaches the top the quickest."

**Framework 5: Consistent Positive Mindset (Morning Routine)**
*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Morning Routine for Mindset Consistency
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  **Establish a Routine:** Develop a specific sequence of activities to start your day.
    2.  **Allocate Dedicated Time:** Commit a short, consistent period (e.g., 5-10 minutes) to this routine daily.
    3.  **Focus on Clarity, Motivation, and Consistency:** Design the routine to ensure you "never drop below a minimum level of clarity, of motivation, of consistency, of just the right mindset to put the right effort in."
*   **Psychology/Principle:** This leverages the power of habit and priming. A consistent morning routine helps set a positive tone for the day, ensuring a foundational level of mental preparedness regardless of external circumstances. It acts as a "reset button" to overcome days when you "didn't feel like it."

### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS
The video *does not provide specific scripts, phrases, or word tracks* for direct use in sales conversations (e.g., opening lines, discovery questions, objection responses, closing phrases, or follow-up messages). The speaker's content focuses entirely on internal mindset shifts and general principles rather than external communication techniques.

### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING
The video *does not discuss specific customer objections or recommended responses* in the traditional sense of objection handling during a sales process. Instead, the speaker talks about **internal objections and self-criticism** he faced ("Why are you such a loser, Richard? Why can't you sponsor people? Why can't you make these sales?"). His recommended "response" to these internal objections is to shift your mindset using the frameworks above: focus on controllable actions, detach from approval, focus on genuine success, and admit/learn from mistakes.

### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS
1.  **Shift Focus from Outcomes to Controllable Actions:** Reduce pressure and build confidence by focusing on the daily activities you can control, knowing that consistent action leads to results.
2.  **Detach from External Approval:** Prioritize your own internal satisfaction and belief in your path, rather than seeking validation from others, as this builds resilience.
3.  **Embrace Genuine Success Over Perceived Success:** Be honest with yourself about your progress and happiness, avoiding the trap of merely appearing successful for social validation.
4.  **Actively Learn from Mistakes:** Cultivate a growth mindset by admitting errors, analyzing what went wrong, and proactively implementing adjustments to improve.
5.  **Implement a Consistent Morning Routine:** Establish a brief daily routine to consistently reset and maintain a positive, clear, and motivated mindset, regardless of how you initially feel.

### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION

These mindset techniques can be highly valuable for Super Patch direct sales teams:

1.  **Outcome-Oriented Action Focus:**
    *   **Application:** Instead of stressing over hitting a specific monthly sales volume, focus on daily actions like: "Today I will prospect 10 new people," "Today I will demonstrate the Super Patch to 3 individuals," or "Today I will follow up with 5 existing customers about their results."
    *   **Example Internal Dialogue:** "I didn't close anyone today, but I completed my 10 new prospects and 3 demos. I'm taking the right actions, and the results will come."

2.  **Detachment from External Approval:**
    *   **Application:** When faced with skepticism about new wellness technology or the "patch" concept, don't let it deflate you. You believe in the science and personal testimonials.
    *   **Example Internal Dialogue:** "Some people might not understand the technology right away, and that's okay. I know the value Super Patch brings, and I'm proud of the relief and support it offers. My conviction is what truly matters."

3.  **Embrace Genuine Success Over Perceived Success:**
    *   **Application:** Don't feel pressured to constantly post "success stories" or exaggerate income claims on social media if it's not authentic. Focus on the genuine connections you're making, the personal growth, and the small victories.
    *   **Example:** Instead of "Look at my huge check!", share "I had a wonderful conversation today helping someone understand their pain relief options with Super Patch, and that felt incredibly rewarding." Or, "I'm genuinely happy with the flexible schedule Super Patch allows me, letting me be more present with my family."

4.  **Admit Mistakes and Learn (Growth Mindset):**
    *   **Application:** After a presentation or follow-up that didn't lead to a sale, objectively review what happened.
    *   **Example:** "That demo didn't go well; I noticed I rushed the explanation of the technology. My mistake was not pausing enough for questions. Next time, I'll slow down and check for understanding at each step, maybe use a visual aid to explain the Vibrotactile Technology better." This also applies to internal processes like managing your customer list or training new team members.

5.  **Consistent Positive Mindset (Morning Routine):**
    *   **Application:** Implement a 5-10 minute morning routine to mentally prepare for the day's sales activities.
    *   **Example Routine:**
        1.  **Gratitude:** List 3 things you're grateful for (e.g., the potential of Super Patch, supportive customers, your health).
        2.  **Visualization:** Visualize a successful Super Patch interaction (e.g., a customer feeling relief, a new team member joining enthusiastically).
        3.  **Affirmation:** Repeat positive affirmations like, "I am a confident Super Patch advocate," or "I connect easily with people who need Super Patch."
        4.  **Review Daily Action Plan:** Briefly look over your planned prospecting, demo, and follow-up activities for the day.
    *   **Benefit:** This routine helps ensure that even on days when you wake up feeling unmotivated, you intentionally shift into a state of readiness and positive expectation for your Super Patch business.

## Network Marketing Training For Beginners

**Source:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PMNesJuFVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PMNesJuFVE)

Here's a structured analysis of the sales training video:

## VIDEO ANALYSIS

### 1. MAIN TOPIC & TECHNIQUE
The primary sales concept/technique taught is **Proactive Time Management & Prioritization using the Alchemy Calendar**. This technique focuses on eliminating overwhelm and procrastination by strategically planning and focusing on high-leverage, productive activities.

### 2. KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

**Framework/Technique Name: The Alchemy Calendar**

This is a daily tool (a spreadsheet calendar) designed to help individuals plan their time, prioritize effectively, and build a positive self-image through consistent action.

**Step-by-step process:**

1.  **Block Out Non-Negotiable Personal Time First:**
    *   **Process:** At the beginning of the year (or quarter), immediately identify and mark all personal, non-negotiable time commitments on the calendar (e.g., school holidays, vacations, important family events, personal appointments). These days are sacred and should be protected from business commitments.
    *   **Psychology/Principle:** This step is crucial for maintaining work-life balance and preventing burnout. By committing to personal time first, it reduces the "guilt" and "overwhelm" of feeling like you "should have done more" (01:34) during those times. It also creates clear boundaries and ensures essential life moments are not sacrificed for business, leading to increased motivation and sustained effort during work periods.

2.  **Focus on One Major Business Project Per Month:**
    *   **Process:** For the active business days in each month, identify *only one* overarching major project or initiative to focus on. Head up the monthly calendar page with this project name.
    *   **Psychology/Principle:** "It gives you the ability to have one clear focus to really drive depth in that project as opposed to just getting, you know, scratching the surface and moving on to something else and not really doing well." (07:38-07:46). This eliminates "overwhelm" from trying to do too many things at once and fosters deep work, leading to higher quality results and a greater sense of accomplishment.

3.  **Plan Tomorrow, Today with Six Productive Actions:**
    *   **Process:** At the end of each working day, before finishing, open the calendar and fill in the "six lines" for the following day with specific, exact, productive actions and activities. These should be "hour-by-hour" (04:08) commitments.
    *   **Psychology/Principle:** "Always plan tomorrow today." (03:55). This proactive planning eliminates decision fatigue and mental clutter upon starting work the next day. Limiting tasks to six ensures they are truly productive and achievable within a realistic timeframe. If you can fit more, great, but six is a strong, proven number. "I know from my own personal experience, if you've really got six really key productive actions in your calendar, you're not really going to fit much else in there, and if you do, you're simply going to have to squeeze it into the next day and get frustrated." (08:18-08:33). This drives focus and prevents procrastination.

4.  **Visually Track and Tick Off Completed Tasks:**
    *   **Process:** As each of the six daily tasks is completed, visually mark it off (e.g., draw a strike-through line, change its color from yellow to grey on the digital calendar).
    *   **Psychology/Principle:** This provides immediate, tangible feedback and a sense of "done, done, done" (10:41) accomplishment. This positive reinforcement is "addictive" (10:00) and starts to "change your self-image" (10:20) from being unorganized or a procrastinator to being focused and productive, bleeding into other areas of life.

### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS

*   **Opening Lines (Value Proposition):**
    "Hey, how's it going? Richard Matther here. So, do you want to know how I went from being stressed, overwhelmed in my network marketing business, always having that sense that I should have done more, I could have done more, I was letting people down, to be able to then release that feeling and be focused and driven and achieve many, many wonderful things that still blow my mind... Number one international income earner, sponsoring 750 people, being that guy that I could, I could finally be proud of, you know, getting on stage and getting all those accolades and recognition. I can't promise you the same results, but what I can promise you is if you watch this training, I'm going to do two things for you. I'm going to dive into how that transformation happened for me so that hopefully you can do something similar in your own business. And I'm also going to give you a download for free that you can use, it's a daily tool that I use. And you're going to be able to download that and use it too, because I want to give you the help that you need, not just information." (00:00-00:58)

*   **Internal Call to Action (Team Sharing):**
    "I highly invite you before we dive into this, to recommend this video to your team. Okay? I'm purposely making sure there's nothing for sale here, there's no mention of any favorite companies, anything like that, so consume this, download that tool, and if you feel your team could get benefit from it, which I feel they will, by all means, you have my permission to share this training with them." (02:00-02:20)

*   **Core Planning Principle:**
    "Always plan tomorrow today." (03:55)

*   **Self-Talk Reframing:**
    *   *(Past, negative self-talk):* "I used to describe myself, 'Hey, you know, I try my best, but I'm not very organized, I'm not very productive, I'm a procrastinator.'" (10:24-10:31)
    *   *(Present, positive self-talk/reframe):* "I start to say to myself, 'Hey Richard, you know, you're not that focused.' I'm like, 'No, I'm getting a lot better at that actually.' 'Hey Richard, you quite procrastinate.' 'Actually, no I don't. I get what I need to do done first.'" (10:44-10:53)

*   **Closing Affirmation:**
    "Go create a day in a life that counts, always have more desires than excuses." (14:19-14:23)

### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING

The video implicitly addresses *internal objections* and common struggles network marketers face rather than external prospect objections.

*   **Common Internal Objections Addressed:**
    *   "I'm stressed and overwhelmed in my business."
    *   "I feel guilty I'm not doing enough, or I could do more."
    *   "I'm unorganized and prone to procrastination."
    *   "I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing on a day-to-day basis." (03:19)

*   **Recommended Responses (via the Alchemy Calendar technique):**
    The entire framework is the "response." By following the step-by-step process of blocking personal time, focusing on one major project, planning tomorrow today with six specific tasks, and visually tracking completion, the individual *overcomes* these internal objections. The clarity and consistent achievement lead to reduced stress, increased focus, and a positive shift in self-image. It moves one from "desperation" (01:43) and being "too much" (01:50) to being confident and effective.

### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1.  **Time is Your Ultimate Resource:** It can be your best friend or worst enemy. Proactive management is key to leveraging it for success and avoiding feelings of guilt and overwhelm.
2.  **Plan Tomorrow, Today:** Implement a strict daily habit of planning the next day's six most important, productive actions the evening before. This eliminates decision fatigue and ensures you start each day with clear direction.
3.  **Prioritize Life, Then Business:** Secure your non-negotiable personal and family time first. This ensures well-being and strengthens your "why," preventing the business from consuming your entire life and leading to burnout.
4.  **Focus on One Major Project at a Time:** Dedicate each month to one primary business project (e.g., customer acquisition, team training, content creation) to achieve depth and significant results, avoiding scattered efforts.
5.  **Track Progress Visually to Build Self-Image:** Use a simple visual tracking method (like striking through completed tasks) to reinforce achievements. This transforms your self-perception from unorganized to highly productive, enhancing confidence and motivation.

### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION

These techniques can be specifically applied to selling Super Patch wellness products in a direct sales/network marketing context:

1.  **Personal Product Experience & Testimonials (Non-Negotiable Time):**
    *   **Application:** Block out dedicated time daily (e.g., 15-30 minutes each morning/evening) to apply your Super Patches, reflect on your experience, and document results. This *must* be prioritized as non-negotiable for product belief and authentic testimonials. For example, "Apply Sleep Patch & journal sleep quality," or "Apply Freedom Patch for gym workout, track performance."
    *   **Benefit:** Ensures consistent product use, generates genuine testimonials, and builds your confidence as a product of the product, which is crucial for direct sales.

2.  **Monthly Super Patch Business Focus (One Major Project):**
    *   **Application:**
        *   **Month 1: "Super Patch Prospecting & Trial Offerings."** Focus the entire month on outreach, setting up mini-trials, and getting initial product experiences into prospects' hands. All six daily tasks (see below) align with this.
        *   **Month 2: "Super Patch Health & Wellness Webinars."** Focus on creating, promoting, and delivering webinars highlighting specific patches or health topics they address (e.g., "The Science of Vibrotactile Stimulation for Pain Relief").
        *   **Month 3: "Super Patch Team Onboarding & Training."** Dedicate to supporting new distributors, teaching them product knowledge, and helping them launch their own businesses effectively.
    *   **Benefit:** Avoids the "shiny object syndrome" of trying to do everything at once. This concentrated effort builds momentum and expertise in one area before moving to the next, yielding better results.

3.  **Daily Six Productive Actions for Super Patch Sales:**
    *   **Application:** At the end of each day, list six specific, time-bound, income-producing activities (IPAs) for the next day related to your monthly focus.
    *   **Example (Month 1: Prospecting & Trial Offerings):**
        1.  **9:00 AM - 9:30 AM:** Message 5 new potential customers on Facebook about the "Boost Patch" energy benefits.
        2.  **10:00 AM - 10:45 AM:** Follow up with 3 individuals who tried the "Relief Patch" last week.
        3.  **1:00 PM - 1:45 PM:** Record a short video testimonial about how "Focus Patch" helped you with concentration today.
        4.  **3:00 PM - 3:30 PM:** Research 2 local wellness groups on Facebook to join for networking.
        5.  **4:00 PM - 4:45 PM:** Prepare 3 "sample packs" of Super Patches for upcoming local event.
        6.  **6:00 PM - 6:30 PM:** Host a quick 15-minute "Patch Party" Q&A live on Instagram.
    *   **Benefit:** Creates absolute clarity on what needs to be done. It ensures focus on "productive" activities that move the needle in Super Patch sales and team building, rather than just "active" but non-income-producing tasks. Ticking them off builds confidence and reinforces a productive identity.

## The Best Network Marketing Scripts - Frazer Brookes

Here's a detailed analysis of the video clip for your direct sales team:

---

## VIDEO ANALYSIS: Network Marketing Scripts & Conversational Flow

### 1. MAIN TOPIC & TECHNIQUE
The primary sales concept/technique being taught is **Leveraging Scripts for Effective Social Media Outreach and Relationship Building in Network Marketing**. The goal is to use scripts as a foundation to develop a natural, flowing conversation that leads to uncovering prospects' needs and potentially introducing your business/product.

### 2. KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

The speaker outlines 8 scenarios where scripts are useful, focusing on the first three in this segment. He emphasizes moving from "investigator" (waiting for signals) to "instigator" (initiating purposeful conversations).

**A. Scripts for Engagement (When Someone Comments on Your Content)**
*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Direct Engagement & Qualification
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  Acknowledge their comment/love/share on your post.
    2.  Engage them based on your goal (casual conversation or qualification).
*   **Psychology/Principle:** Reciprocity and personalized interaction. People appreciate being acknowledged. Direct qualification saves time if you have many comments.

**B. Scripts for Connection (When Someone Friend Requests You or Follows You)**
*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Immediate Connection & Value Proposition
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  Quickly accept/follow back.
    2.  Immediately send a message (ideally a voice note on Instagram for personal touch).
    3.  Express excitement/gratitude for the connection/follow.
    4.  Briefly state *how you help people* (your value proposition).
    5.  Ask a qualifying question to see if they might be interested in that help.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** Strike while the iron is hot. Don't delay. Demonstrate your value and quickly ascertain if there's a potential mutual interest. Avoid being an "investigator" waiting for *them* to initiate further.

**C. Scripts for Outreach (When You Need to Reach Out to Someone)**
*   **Framework/Technique Name:** The "LORD" Framework (Location, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams)
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  **"Hey [Name]..."**: Start with a personalized greeting.
    2.  **"...how you found them..."**: Clearly state how you came across their profile/contact (e.g., "I saw your post in the [Group Name] about [Topic]..." or "I noticed you're based in [Location]..."). This legitimizes your outreach.
    3.  **"...ask a question."**: Formulate a question based on one of the "LORD" categories:
        *   **L**ocation: Ask about their city, local attractions, weather, local cuisine.
        *   **O**ccupation: Ask about their job, how they like it, challenges, how long they've been doing it.
        *   **R**ecreation: Ask about their hobbies, what they do for fun, if they get to do it often.
        *   **D**reams: Ask about their aspirations, goals, or what they'd wish for if they had a magic wand.
*   **Psychology/Principle:** This framework provides a natural, non-salesy way to initiate a conversation with a stranger by showing genuine interest. It avoids leading with your business and instead focuses on them. It also allows you to make notes and gather intel for future conversations. He emphasizes that if you ask what their "dream" is, it reveals if they are likely a "right prospect" who knows what they want and need more (a good indicator for network marketing).

### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS

*   **When someone comments on your content (Option 1 - Casual):**
    *   "Hey [Name], thanks so much for the love on my post. How are you?"
*   **When someone comments on your content (Option 2 - Direct Qualification):**
    *   "Hey [Name], thanks so much for the love on my post. Do you want more information on how I help people to [**BLANK - insert your key benefit/solution**]? Or were you just supporting?"
*   **When someone friend requests you (Facebook):**
    *   "Hey [Name], great to be connected with you here on Facebook. How are you?"
*   **When someone follows you (Instagram - suggested voice note):**
    *   "Hey [Name], super excited to be connected with you here on Instagram. Thanks for following me! I help people to [**BLANK - insert your key benefit/solution**]. Do you feel like I can help you with something?"
*   **When you reach out to someone (LORD framework - General Structure):**
    *   "Hey [Name], [how you found them - e.g., I saw your post in the Yoga Moms group / I noticed you're based in Jamaica / I saw you're a vineyard manager], [ask a question based on L.O.R.D.]."

### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING

*   **Objection:** "I've been using that script you shared and it doesn't work."
    *   **Response:** "First and foremost, it's either you didn't do enough of it, or you're sending the wrong message. It's almost all the time it's you are either A) sending the wrong message or doing the wrong thing, or not doing enough of the right thing. Quantity usually solves all the problems in this network marketing game. People say it's a numbers game, but it's only a numbers game if you play the game right."
*   **Objection:** "It's weird reaching out to strangers anyway."
    *   **Response:** "I know. But go and ask your top income earner [in your company] how much money they made last week, and the number they give you is gonna be very, very weird. Do you want to do the weird activity to get the weird commission, or do you want to keep thinking, 'Oh yeah, but it's too weird, I'm not gonna do that because I'm not a weirdo.' I would rather be weird and rich than not. In fact, I would say in some way, the rich people out there, the wealthy people out there are a little bit weird. Why? Because they do what everyone else is not doing."
    *   **Reframe on Persuasion:** "You don't convince, we sort through the people who are open and we persuade the people who need persuading. Persuading is not a bad thing."

### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1.  **Scripts are a Starting Point:** Use them to build confidence and understand the flow, but adapt them to your authentic voice and make them your own.
2.  **Be an Instigator, Not Just an Investigator:** Actively initiate conversations rather than waiting for others to come to you. Don't let friend requests or follows sit unanswered.
3.  **Focus on Them First (LORD Framework):** Build rapport by asking genuine questions about their Location, Occupation, Recreation, or Dreams. This uncovers potential needs naturally.
4.  **Embrace "Weird" for Uncommon Results:** The fear of being perceived as "weird" often prevents people from taking the necessary actions for extraordinary success. Be willing to do what others aren't.
5.  **Attention is Currency:** Pay genuine attention to others' lives and interests, and they will, in turn, be more likely to pay attention to your message.

### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION

Here's how these techniques can be specifically applied to selling Super Patch wellness products:

**General Principles for Super Patch:**
*   Always focus on the *benefit* (pain relief, better sleep, more energy, improved focus) not just the product itself.
*   Emphasize the *unique technology* (vibrotactile) and *natural/drug-free* aspect.
*   Connect the patch benefits directly to their stated interests or problems.

**A. When Someone Comments on Your Content:**
*   **Option 1 (Casual, if their comment is generic):** "Hey [Name], thanks so much for the love on my post! How are you doing today?" (If they mention a health struggle, pivot to option 2).
*   **Option 2 (Direct Qualification, if their comment indicates interest in health/wellness):** "Hey [Name], thanks for showing some love on my post! I noticed you're interested in [e.g., natural health solutions/improving sleep/managing discomfort]. I help people achieve [better sleep/natural pain relief/sustained energy] using our innovative Super Patch technology. Would you be open to learning a bit more about it, or were you just supporting the content?"

**B. When Someone Friend Requests/Follows You:**
*   **Facebook (after accepting):** "Hey [Name], great to be connected with you here on Facebook! How are you? I share a lot about how people are finding natural ways to feel their best and manage daily wellness challenges using something called Super Patches. Is that something you're curious about, or more interested in general health content?"
*   **Instagram (voice note):** "Hey [Name], super excited to connect with you and thanks for following! I use and share about this amazing Super Patch technology that's helping people like me get incredible results with sleep, energy, and even pain relief. I help others discover how this works – do you feel like I could help you with any of those areas?"

**C. When You Reach Out to Someone (Using LORD Framework):**
*   **L**ocation (e.g., to someone from Colorado who enjoys outdoor activities):
    *   "Hey [Name], I noticed you're based in [Colorado] – I hear the hiking and mountain biking there are incredible! How often do you get out on the trails? I ask because I help active people improve their recovery and boost natural energy with a unique wearable technology, so they can do more of what they love without being held back."
*   **O**ccupation (e.g., to a teacher/healthcare worker):
    *   "Hey [Name], I saw on your profile you're a [teacher/nurse]. That must be incredibly demanding on your body and mind! How do you manage to maintain your energy and focus through long days? I work with professionals who are using a natural, non-invasive technology to support sustained energy and sharper focus without caffeine or jitters. Would you be open to hearing about it?"
*   **R**ecreation (e.g., to someone who plays a sport or has a physically demanding hobby):
    *   "Hey [Name], I love that you're into [golf/gardening/running]! Do you ever find yourself struggling with muscle soreness, stiff joints, or needing better recovery so you can get back to it quickly? I help people optimize their recovery and manage discomfort using a revolutionary wellness patch. Is that something you might find beneficial?"
*   **D**reams (e.g., to someone whose profile hints at aspirations for more energy/freedom):
    *   "Hey [Name], I know this might sound a little out there, but if I had a magic wand and could grant you one wish to improve your health or wellbeing right now (like better sleep, more energy, or freedom from discomfort), what would that wish be? I ask because my work involves helping people achieve those very things naturally with cutting-edge technology."

By applying these structured approaches and personalizing them with the specific benefits of Super Patch, your direct sales team can build stronger connections and effectively introduce your products.

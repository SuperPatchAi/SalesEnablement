## 1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW (Clinical Focus)

**REM** is Super Patch's drug-free sleep support solution, designed to help patients fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, and wake feeling refreshed – all without sleep medications. Utilizing **Vibrotactile Technology (VTT)**, REM works through neural pathway activation based on Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research.

### Clinical Mechanism of Action

REM's VTT works through evidence-based mechanisms:

1. **Mechanoreceptor Activation:** Specialized ridge patterns stimulate skin receptors
2. **Neural Pathway Modulation:** Activates calming neural responses that support natural sleep processes
3. **Circadian Support:** Helps regulate sleep-wake cycle naturally
4. **No Chemical Sedation:** Works with the body's own systems, not against them

## 3. OPENING SCRIPTS

Build rapport with evidence-focused, solution-oriented approaches.

### 1. Cold Call Script

**Scenario:** Calling an integrative medicine practice.

"Good morning, this is [Your Name] from Super Patch. I'm reaching out to practitioners who are looking for drug-free sleep solutions for their patients.

We have a clinical study – the HARMONI study – showing remarkable results: patients fell asleep 46% faster and 80% were able to stop their sleep medications over 14 days.

I know sleep is foundational to everything you're trying to accomplish with patients. Do you currently have a drug-free option you recommend for insomnia patients who want to avoid or discontinue sleep medications?

[Listen for response]

Would it be helpful if I sent over the clinical study results and set up a brief call to discuss how REM might fit into your sleep protocols?"

### 2. Email Introduction Script

**Subject Line Options:**
- "HARMONI Study: 80% of Patients Stopped Sleep Medications"
- "Drug-Free Sleep Solution: 46% Faster Sleep Onset (Clinical Data)"
- "For [Practice Name]: Evidence-Based Alternative to Sleep Meds"

**Email Body:**

"Dr. [Name],

Sleep medication dependence is one of the most challenging clinical situations to address. Patients want to stop, you want them to stop, but the alternatives often aren't effective enough.

Our REM patch offers a clinically-studied solution. The HARMONI Study demonstrated:
- 46% faster time to fall asleep (69 min → 37 min)
- 1.5 additional hours of sleep per night
- 74% reduction in night waking
- 80% of participants stopped sleep medications during the 14-day study

The technology uses Vibrotactile Technology (VTT) – neural pathway activation based on Nobel Prize-winning research. No sedation, no grogginess, no dependency risk.

For your practice, this means:
✓ A evidence-based tool for medication tapering protocols
✓ Support for patients who can't or won't take sleep meds
✓ 25% practitioner discount for wholesale/resale
✓ No contraindications with existing medications

Would a 15-minute call to review the clinical data work for you this week?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Super Patch Healthcare Practitioner Program"

### 3. LinkedIn/Social Media Outreach Script

"Hi Dr. [Name],

I noticed your focus on [functional medicine/integrative health/etc.] and wanted to connect about sleep support.

We've helped practitioners offer their patients a drug-free sleep solution – backed by clinical data showing 80% of participants stopped their sleep medications over 14 days.

Sleep is so foundational to every healing protocol. Would you be interested in seeing the HARMONI study results? I'm happy to share the data and discuss practitioner partnership options.

[Your Name]"

### 4. Referral Introduction Script

"Hi Dr. [Name], this is [Your Name] from Super Patch. Dr. [Referrer] suggested I reach out – they've been using our REM patches to help patients transition off sleep medications and thought your approach to sleep would align perfectly.

They mentioned you see patients who struggle with insomnia but are hesitant about sleep medications. Is that a common scenario in your practice?

[Listen]

Great. The clinical data has been really compelling for practitioners in your specialty. Would you like me to send the HARMONI study results so you can evaluate the evidence?"

### 5. Conference/Networking Event Script

"Hi, I'm [Your Name] with Super Patch. Do you deal much with sleep issues in your practice?

[If yes:] Then you probably know how problematic long-term sleep medication use can be. We have a drug-free alternative backed by clinical data – the HARMONI study showed 80% of participants stopped their sleep meds over 14 days. Patients fell asleep 46% faster and got an extra 1.5 hours of sleep.

Would you be interested in seeing the study? It might be a good fit for your patients who want off medications."

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION SCRIPT (2-Minute)

**(Problem-Agitate-Solve-Evidence Framework)**

**(PROBLEM)**

"Sleep disorders affect nearly 70 million Americans, and for practitioners, it's become one of the most challenging issues to address. Your patients are caught between suffering through sleepless nights or taking medications that carry real risks – dependency, tolerance, morning grogginess, cognitive impairment, and even increased fall risk in elderly patients.

The gap in effective, non-pharmaceutical sleep solutions means patients either accept poor sleep as normal or become dependent on medications that were never intended for long-term use."

**(AGITATE)**

"This isn't just about being tired – sleep is foundational to every system in the body. Patients with poor sleep don't heal properly. They're more prone to inflammation, weight gain, mood disorders, and cognitive decline. Every protocol you recommend is undermined when patients aren't sleeping.

And the alternatives? Melatonin helps some people initially but tolerance develops. Sleep hygiene education is necessary but often insufficient. CBT-I is effective but access is limited. You need something that works, is safe for long-term use, and that you can confidently recommend."

**(SOLVE)**

"That's why I'm excited to share the Super Patch REM. It's a completely drug-free sleep support solution using Vibrotactile Technology – neural pathway activation rather than chemical sedation.

Patients simply apply the patch before bed. The specialized ridge patterns interact with mechanoreceptors – the same pathways recognized by the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine – to activate natural calming responses that support healthy sleep patterns.

There's nothing going into the body. No sedation, no grogginess, no dependency risk. Patients wake up refreshed rather than foggy."

**(EVIDENCE)**

"But here's what makes REM remarkable: the clinical evidence. The HARMONI study followed 113 adults with sleep difficulties over 14 days:
- Patients fell asleep 46% faster – from 69 minutes down to 37 minutes
- Total sleep increased by 1.5 hours per night
- Night waking decreased by 74%
- And most importantly – 80% of participants stopped using sleep medications during the study

Safety was excellent with only minor adverse events, and 70% of patients preferred the patch over their sleep medications.

For your patients who want to sleep better without drugs, this is the evidence-based option you can recommend with confidence. Would you like to see the full study?"

***

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING (Conversation Aikido)

### 1. "Sleep issues are usually symptoms of other underlying problems."

**Response:** "Absolutely – and that's what you're treating at the root cause. But here's the clinical reality: patients need to sleep to heal. Poor sleep undermines every other intervention.

REM can support patients while you address underlying causes – whether that's stress, hormonal imbalance, or gut issues. Think of it as enabling your treatment plan, not replacing it. How do you currently support patients' sleep while working on root causes?"

### 2. "Melatonin and magnesium usually work for my patients."

**Response:** "Those are great foundational options and work well for some patients. What about the patients where those aren't enough – the more stubborn insomnia cases?

The HARMONI study participants had been struggling with sleep issues despite trying other solutions. REM showed significant improvements even in that population. Would it be valuable to have an additional tool for those harder cases?"

### 3. "I need to see peer-reviewed evidence before recommending anything."

**Response:** "I completely appreciate that evidence-based standard. The HARMONI study is available for your review – 113 participants, 14-day protocol, with impressive outcome measures including 80% medication discontinuation.

What specific aspects of the study design would be most important for you to evaluate – sample size, outcome measures, or safety data?"

### 4. "My patients have tried everything – they're skeptical anything will work."

**Response:** "That skepticism makes sense after years of struggling. Interestingly, the HARMONI study participants were adults who'd had difficulty falling or staying asleep – they weren't easy cases.

The 46% improvement in sleep onset time and 80% medication discontinuation rate happened in that population. Sometimes positioning it as 'clinically studied, works differently than what you've tried' opens the door. What has your experience been with presenting new options to skeptical patients?"

### 5. "What if patients become dependent on the patch?"

**Response:** "That's exactly the right concern with any sleep intervention. The key difference is mechanism – REM works through neural pathway activation, not chemical sedation.

There's no CNS depression, no tolerance development, no withdrawal concern. Patients can use it consistently or as needed. The HARMONI study showed 80% stopped their actual sleep medications, so it's actually a tool for reducing dependency. Does understanding the mechanism difference help?"

### 6. "How is this different from other 'natural sleep' products that don't work?"

**Response:** "That's a fair question – the sleep supplement market is crowded with unproven products. What separates REM is clinical evidence and mechanism.

We have the HARMONI study with objective outcome measures – not just testimonials. And VTT works through mechanoreceptor activation, the same pathways in Nobel Prize-winning research. It's not just 'another supplement.' Would reviewing the clinical mechanism be helpful?"

### 7. "The cost is hard to justify compared to melatonin or OTC sleep aids."

**Response:** "I understand that initial cost comparison. The value equation changes when you consider effectiveness and outcomes though.

OTC sleep aids leave patients groggy and aren't intended for long-term use. The HARMONI study showed REM patients got 1.5 additional hours of quality sleep and 80% stopped their sleep medications. What's the value of effective, drug-free sleep support to your patients?"

### 8. "I don't have time to add another product to my recommendations."

**Response:** "I hear that – practice demands are real. Practitioners who've adopted REM actually find it simplifies sleep conversations.

Instead of a complicated discussion about medication options and risks, they recommend one evidence-based solution. The patch is simple – apply before bed, no complex protocols. Would it help to have a streamlined option for sleep that you can recommend quickly?"

***

## 7. CLOSING SCRIPTS

### 1. The Clinical Evidence Close

"Given that the HARMONI study showed 80% of participants stopped their sleep medications and patients fell asleep 46% faster, would you like to set up a practitioner account to trial REM with your sleep-struggling patients?"

### 2. The Medication Tapering Close

"You mentioned helping patients reduce their sleep medication use is a priority. REM was specifically shown to support that – 80% discontinuation rate in the study.

Would you like to add REM to your toolkit for medication tapering protocols?"

### 3. The Foundational Sleep Close

"You mentioned that poor sleep undermines every other treatment you're providing. REM could be the foundational support that makes your other protocols more effective.

Shall we set up your practitioner account so you can start recommending it to appropriate patients?"

### 4. The Pilot Program Close

"Rather than a full commitment, would you like to start with a pilot – recommend REM to 5-10 patients struggling with sleep over the next 30 days and evaluate results?

That way you can see how it performs in your patient population before making any larger decisions."

### 5. The Patient Demand Close

"With more patients requesting drug-free options and sleep being such a common concern, having REM available positions you to meet that demand with an evidence-based solution.

Would you like to get set up so you're ready when those patients ask?"

## VIDEO ANALYSIS

### 1. MAIN TOPIC & TECHNIQUE

The primary sales concept/technique being taught is **Conversation Aikido**. This technique focuses on deflecting objections and questions by understanding the underlying emotion/need and then guiding the conversation with open-ended questions, rather than directly answering or arguing.

### 2. KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

**Framework/Technique Name:** Conversation Aikido

**Step-by-step process:**

1.  **Receive the Statement/Objection:** The customer presents a statement, question, or objection (e.g., "Your product is too expensive," "You're always late").
2.  **Acknowledge and Understand (Don't Answer):** Instead of immediately providing an answer or counter-argument, the salesperson expresses understanding and paraphrases the customer's statement or the feeling behind it. The key is to convey empathy and show you've heard them.
3.  **Ask an Open-Ended Question:** Immediately follow the acknowledgment with an open-ended question designed to uncover the *real*, deeper issue, need, or interest driving their initial statement.

**The psychology/principle behind why it works:**

*   **Avoids "Stupidity" (Emotional Overload):** The speaker uses a brain model to illustrate that when emotions rise (e.g., due to feeling attacked or argued with), the logical thinking part of the brain "disconnects." Direct answers or arguments raise emotions, making the other person less receptive to logic. "The higher emotion goes, the lower thinking goes." (0:55, 2:43-3:00)
*   **Uncovers the Real Issue:** Surface-level objections (like "too expensive") are often not the true underlying problem. By avoiding a direct answer and instead asking an open question, you create an opportunity to discover what's *really* driving their hesitation, concern, or need. "When someone says your product is too expensive, that's not what their real issue is." (2:15-2:18)
*   **Uses Their Energy Against Them (Aikido):** Like in martial arts, where an opponent's force is used against them, Conversation Aikido uses the energy of the objection to move the conversation forward constructively. You "go towards the punch, dodge it, and look and you're seeing the world in the same direction as the person who's attacking you." (4:28-4:54)
*   **Fosters Connection and Trust:** By demonstrating active listening and a genuine desire to understand their perspective, you build rapport and trust. "I understand and accepting the energy that's coming from the other person and then giving back an open question." (7:00-7:08)
*   **Shuts Down Argumentation:** It prevents the conversation from devolving into a "no, it's not" debate, which yields no valuable information and damages the relationship. "By giving the answer, we shut down the possibility of hearing what's really going on." (6:23-6:29)

### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS

*   **General Opening Line for Understanding:** "I understand..." (3:39) or "I understand that..." (3:47)
*   **General Structure for Objection Response:** "I understand that [restate their point in your words or describe the emotion you infer]. [Open-ended question to uncover deeper need/interest]."

*   **Specific Objection Responses:**
    *   **"Your product is too expensive."** (0:05, 1:28, 2:15, 3:47, 5:44, 6:33)
        *   **Recommended Response:** "I understand that money is an important factor for you. What other criteria will be used in taking this decision?" (3:47-3:56)
        *   **Alternative/Refined:** "I understand that money is an important criteria for you. What other things are important in this decision?" (6:36-6:41)
    *   **"You're always late."** (0:17) (Used as a personal analogy)
        *   **Recommended Response:** "I understand you feel frustrated. I understand you feel let down." (5:10-5:14) (Note: The speaker emphasizes understanding the *feeling* here.)
    *   **"I'll have to speak to my boss."** (2:20, 6:43)
        *   **Recommended Response:** "Hey, this is an important decision, I understand you want to get everyone involved. When can I come and meet with you and your boss together?" (6:44-6:53) (Note: The speaker then self-corrects, implying a more open question might be better. The emphasis is on understanding *why* they need to consult the boss.)
    *   **General Inquiry to understand deeper issues:**
        *   "What can we do now?" (5:28)
        *   "What happened during the day?" (5:30)
        *   "What would you like to talk about?" (5:31)
        *   "What could we do this weekend?" (5:33)

### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING

*   **Common objections mentioned:**
    *   "It's quite expensive / Your product is too expensive."
    *   "You're always late." (Analogy)
    *   "You never wash the dishes." (Analogy)
    *   "I'll have to speak to my boss."
    *   "Your competitor is better."
    *   "You failed us three years ago."
    *   "I don't trust your company."

*   **Recommended responses (exact wording if provided):** See Section 3 above. The core is the "I understand + open question" structure.

*   **The reframe or psychology behind each response:** The goal is to move beyond the stated objection to uncover the customer's genuine needs, concerns, past experiences, decision-making criteria, and influencing factors, by inviting them to share more rather than shutting them down with a defensive answer. This approach keeps emotions low and encourages thoughtful, honest communication.

### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1.  **Don't Answer, Understand:** The fundamental rule is to resist the urge to directly answer questions or objections. Instead, listen, acknowledge, and seek to understand the underlying concern.
2.  **Use "I Understand" + Open Question:** Master the core "Conversation Aikido" technique: "I understand that [your interpretation of their point/feeling]. What [open-ended question to gain deeper insight]?"
3.  **Control Emotional Response:** Recognize that direct arguments increase emotion and decrease rational thinking. Your calm, understanding approach keeps the conversation productive.
4.  **Practice Consistently:** You have years of training to answer questions. It will take conscious, repeated practice (at least 18 years, as the speaker joked) to rewire this habit and effectively implement Conversation Aikido in the heat of the moment.
5.  **Seek the "Real Underlying Need":** The ultimate objective is to go beneath the surface to identify the customer's true needs, issues, interests, and decision-making drivers, which are rarely articulated in the initial objection.

### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION

Here's how these techniques can be specifically applied to selling Super Patch wellness products in a direct sales/network marketing context:

*   **Product Context:** Super Patch offers non-invasive, drug-free wellness solutions via patented vibrating patterns, often focusing on areas like pain relief, sleep, balance, and energy. Customers might be skeptical of the technology, price, or efficacy compared to traditional methods.

*   **Specific Examples:**

    1.  **Objection: "These patches seem too expensive for just a sticker."**
        *   **Conversation Aikido Response:** "I understand that the cost is an important consideration, and you want to ensure you're getting value for your investment. What specific health or wellness goals are you hoping to achieve, and what other factors are you weighing when considering a new solution?"
        *   **Psychology:** Acknowledges financial concern but immediately pivots to their personal health goals and broader decision criteria, moving beyond just the price tag to the *value* it might provide relative to their needs.

    2.  **Objection: "I've tried a lot of different supplements/remedies for my pain, and nothing seems to work. Why would Super Patch be different?"**
        *   **Conversation Aikido Response:** "I hear your frustration with past experiences, and it makes complete sense that you're cautious after trying so many things. Can you tell me a little more about what you've tried and what specifically you found disappointing or ineffective about them?"
        *   **Psychology:** Validates their skepticism and past negative experiences, building empathy. It then prompts them to elaborate, helping you understand their specific pain points and perhaps identify gaps in previous solutions that Super Patch might address.

    3.  **Objection: "I need to talk to my doctor before I try anything new like this."**
        *   **Conversation Aikido Response:** "I completely understand and respect your desire to consult with your doctor, as health decisions are always important. What specific questions or information do you think your doctor would need to evaluate Super Patch, or what concerns do you anticipate they might have?"
        *   **Psychology:** Reinforces their autonomy and caution, making them feel heard. It shifts the focus from a blanket deferral to specific, actionable information needed for the doctor, which you might be able to provide or help them frame.

    4.  **Objection: "How does a patch really help me sleep/have more energy? It sounds like magic."**
        *   **Conversation Aikido Response:** "I appreciate your curiosity about the science behind Super Patch, as it is a unique approach to wellness. What specifically about the 'how it works' aspect interests you most, or what makes you feel it might be 'magic'?"
        *   **Psychology:** Encourages them to voice their specific areas of disbelief or curiosity about the underlying technology. This allows you to provide targeted information or demonstrations rather than a generic explanation that might not address their core skepticism.

    5.  **Objection: "My friend tried it and didn't feel anything."**
        *   **Conversation Aikido Response:** "I hear that your friend's experience left you wondering if it would work for you, and personal experiences can certainly be influential. Can you tell me more about what your friend was hoping to achieve, and what their specific routine or expectations were when using the patch?"
        *   **Psychology:** Acknowledges the negative social proof but creates an opportunity to understand the context of the friend's experience (e.g., perhaps they used the wrong patch, for the wrong reason, or had unrealistic expectations). This helps prevent general dismissal based on limited information.

By consistently applying Conversation Aikido, your sales team can move beyond transactional responses to build deeper relationships, truly understand customer needs, and effectively position Super Patch as the right solution.

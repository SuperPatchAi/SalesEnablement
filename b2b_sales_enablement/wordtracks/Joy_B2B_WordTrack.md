## 3. OPENING SCRIPTS

### 1. Cold Call
"Good morning, this is [Your Name] from Super Patch.

Our Joy patch uses Vibrotactile Technology to support emotional well-being – drug-free. Do you have patients who need mood support but prefer non-pharmaceutical options?"

### 2. Email Introduction
**Subject:** Drug-Free Mood Support for Your Wellness Patients

Mood affects treatment compliance, pain perception, and overall health outcomes. But pharmaceutical options aren't always appropriate, and many patients prefer drug-free approaches.

Our Joy patch uses Vibrotactile Technology – neural pathway support for emotional well-being. Drug-free, no discontinuation effects, no contraindications.

Would you be open to discussing how this could support your patients' emotional wellness?

Best regards,

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION (2-Minute)

**[PROBLEM]**
"Mood is foundational to health – it affects pain perception, immune function, compliance, and quality of life. Yet the gap between 'doing fine' and 'needs medication' leaves many patients without support. They don't meet criteria for antidepressants, don't want pharmaceutical side effects, or simply prefer natural approaches. But 'think positive' isn't adequate support."

**[SOLUTION]**
"Joy uses Vibrotactile Technology to support mood-related neural pathways. Based on Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research, it provides ongoing emotional wellness support without pharmaceuticals, without side effects, and without the weeks-long onset of traditional medications.

For your practice: a drug-free option for emotional wellness support, better overall treatment outcomes, and 25% practitioner margin. Would you like to trial this with appropriate patients?"

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Depression and mood disorders need proper treatment."
**Response:** "Absolutely – clinical depression requires comprehensive care. Joy isn't for clinical depression; it's for subclinical mood support and emotional wellness optimization. For patients who don't meet medication criteria but still struggle with low mood, Joy provides supportive care. For those in treatment, it can complement their program."

### "How can a patch affect mood without neurotransmitter action?"
**Response:** "VTT works through mechanoreceptor activation affecting neural pathways – including those involved in mood regulation. The nervous system influences mood through multiple mechanisms beyond just neurotransmitter levels. By optimizing neural signaling, Joy supports emotional well-being through the body's own systems."

### "Mood issues require addressing underlying causes."
**Response:** "You're right to look for root causes – and Joy supports that process. When mood is supported, patients engage better with treatment, make better lifestyle choices, and can address underlying issues more effectively. It's about providing stability while you work on foundational factors."

### "I'm not comfortable recommending products for mood."
**Response:** "I understand the sensitivity. Joy isn't positioned as treatment for mood disorders – it's wellness support for emotional well-being, similar to how you might recommend exercise or meditation for mood. It's a tool for patients who want proactive support, not a clinical intervention."

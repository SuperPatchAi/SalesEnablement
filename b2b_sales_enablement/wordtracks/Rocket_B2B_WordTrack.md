## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Men's vitality issues may indicate underlying conditions."
**Response:** "Absolutely – proper evaluation is important. Rocket isn't diagnostic or a replacement for clinical workup. It's supportive wellness for men who've been evaluated and want optimization support, or for those whose vitality concerns don't indicate pathology but still affect quality of life."

### "How can a patch support men's vitality without hormones?"
**Response:** "VTT works through mechanoreceptor activation affecting neural pathways involved in energy, wellness, and vitality. The nervous system plays a significant role in how we feel – energy, motivation, well-being. By optimizing these neural signals, Rocket supports vitality through the body's own systems, not hormonal intervention."

### "Men need to optimize lifestyle before adding products."
**Response:** "Lifestyle is foundational – and Rocket supports that effort. When men feel better, they exercise more, make better choices, and engage with life. It's about supporting the positive cycle while they work on sleep, exercise, stress, and nutrition."

### "This is a sensitive area to recommend products."
**Response:** "I understand – men's health requires sensitivity. Rocket is positioned as wellness support, not treatment for dysfunction. It's for men who want to feel their best, have more energy, and optimize their well-being. The conversation is about vitality and quality of life, not medical intervention."

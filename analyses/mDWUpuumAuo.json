MAIN TOPIC & TECHNIQUE\n\nThe primary sales concept taught is **Prospect Self-Persuasion through De-framing Pain and Fear of Future Pain.** The core technique is **Consequence Questioning** delivered with a **Concerned Tone**, leading to **Identity Framing**, to encourage prospects to persuade *themselves* to change.\n\n### 2. KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS\n\n**A. Understanding the Drivers for Change:**\n*   **Principle:** Humans are driven to change by **pain** and the **fear of future pain**. If a prospect doesn't feel pain or fear of future pain related to their current situation, they see no need to change and will give objections.\n*   **Process:**\n    1.  Identify the prospect's current problems/pain points related to your product/service (even if seemingly superficial).\n    2.  Use layered \"Consequence Questions\" to uncover the deeper, more significant impacts of these problems on their life, business, and relationships.\n\n**B. De-Framing through Consequence Questioning & Concerned Tone:**\n*   **Framework/Technique Name:** De-Framing with Consequence Questions (using a Concerned Tone)\n*   **Step-by-step process:**\n    1.  Prospect expresses an objection or desire to delay. (e.g., \"Now's not a good time for us, we'll get back to you.\")\n    2.  Salesperson uses a **concerned tone** and asks for permission to ask a direct, potentially uncomfortable question.\n    3.  Salesperson asks a layered \"Consequence Question\" about the impact of *not* solving the problem, moving from immediate consequences to deeper, more significant ones (financial, relational, identity-based).\n    4.  Salesperson continues to ask \"And what happens then?\" or \"How does that impact X?\" until the prospect fully articulates and *feels* the profound negative consequences of their inaction.\n    5.  The concerned tone seeds doubt in the prospect's mind, lowering their guard and making them more open to considering their decision.\n\n*   **Psychology/Principle:**\n    *   **Consequence Questioning:** Forces the prospect to visualize and emotionally connect with the negative outcomes of maintaining their status quo or delaying action. It moves them from a logical, superficial objection to an emotional, deeper realization of potential loss.\n    *   **Concerned Tone:** Projects empathy and genuine care, making the salesperson seem like an ally rather than an aggressive seller. This disarms the prospect, triggering doubt about their own decision without making them feel attacked. The prospect unconsciously feels the salesperson knows something they don't, which makes them more receptive.\n\n**C. Identity Framing:**\n*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Identity Framing\n*   **Step-by-step process:**\n    1.  Once the prospect is de-framed and has acknowledged the deep consequences of inaction (pain and fear of future pain), the salesperson introduces a question that contrasts their desired identity with the identity of someone who *fails* to address the problem.\n    2.  The question makes the prospect choose between identifying with a negative, undesirable archetype (e.g., \"executives who never get promoted because they neglect their health\") and a positive, aspirational one (e.g., \"someone who optimizes their health for peak performance\").\n*   **Psychology/Principle:** Humans are driven by who they believe themselves to be and who they aspire to be. By linking inaction to an undesirable identity and action to a desired one, the salesperson taps into a powerful intrinsic motivator. The prospect will want to *run away* from the negative identity and *run towards* the positive one, thus persuading themselves to buy.\n\n### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS\n\n*   **Common Objections/Frames (from 0:03-0:11):**\n    *   \"I don't have the money\"\n    *   \"Will it work for me?\"\n    *   \"I'm not sure I should do it\"\n    *   \"Next year is better\"\n    *   \"I'll do it down the road\"\n    *   \"I need to think it over\"\n    *   \"I need to do more research\"\n    *   \"How much is it going to cost?\"\n\n*   **Email Death/Delay Response (from 0:31-0:39):**\n    *   \"Ah, we really liked you and what you had to say, but... now's not a good time for us. We'll get back to you when we are interested. Keep in touch!\"\n\n*   **Opening Consequence Question (general, from 1:18):**\n    *   \"And what are the consequences if they don't purchase your program?\"\n\n*   **Layered Consequence Questions (demonstrated by speaker with prospect on health consulting, from 1:23-1:57):**\n    *   \"Okay, and if they lose a lot of money and productivity, what's the consequences? Like, what happens then?\"\n    *   \"Uh, their business won't make as much money and won't perform as well.\"\n    *   \"And what happens to the business then, when it doesn't perform?\"\n    *   \"Probably won't be around much longer.\"\n    *   \"And what happens then when it goes out of business?\"\n    *   \"Uh, they'll probably be busking outside the casino.\" (Speaker clarifies: \"No, no seriously, I mean, on a serious note, like what happens to the business owner when they go under?\")\n    *   \"Uh, not good things.\"\n    *   \"Like what, tell me.\"\n    *   \"Uh, they'll be unemployed.\"\n    *   \"Okay, and they're not making any money, what happens to their family?\"\n    *   \"Can't provide for the family, yeah.\" (Speaker: \"It's much deeper than just fixing their health.\")\n\n*   **De-Framing Question with Concerned Tone (from 3:08 and 5:50):**\n    *   \"Can I, hey, can I um, can I ask you something and you can always get back to me down the road, can I can I ask you something?\"\n    *   *Prospect:* \"Sure.\"\n    *   *Salesperson:* (Concerned Tone) \"How um... how could I communicate to you that you might be making a mistake, without you getting upset with me?\"\n    *   *Self-Correction Example (from 5:50):* \"Yeah, not a problem. Um, can I, can I ask you something before I, you always call, call me in a couple months. Can I ask you something before I, before I head out?\"\n    *   *Prospect:* \"Oh, no, I don't really have time, mate, sorry.\"\n    *   *Salesperson:* \"Well, yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't want to get you angry at me. I guess the question I had for you, and like I said, you always get back to me. How, how can I communicate to you, that, that you might be making a mistake, without you getting upset with me?\"\n\n*   **Identity Frame Question (demonstrated from 7:00-7:40):**\n    *   *Salesperson:* \"I mean, how does your spouse feel about it though? Like, does your spouse, like, does she want you to keep having these issues where you like having a hard time even performing at work? Like, does she want you to have to keep going through that?\"\n    *   *Prospect:* \"Nah, she's pretty pissed at me.\"\n    *   *Salesperson:* \"How do you mean by pissed?\"\n    *   *Prospect:* \"Uh, she's probably, probably not happy with me.\"\n    *   *Salesperson:* \"Okay. I don't want, I don't want you sleeping on the couch tonight, man. But, but, but in all seriousness. Does she want you to get your health back so you can really get promoted into that CEO role, so you can make more money for the family? Or what does she want you to do?\"\n    *   *Prospect:* \"Yeah, she would love that.\"\n    *   *Salesperson:* \"Okay. But why now? Like, why, why look at doing this now? Like, why not, you know, push it down the road like a lot of executives do, who end up never fixing their health and they never get promoted?\"\n    *   *Prospect:* \"Yeah, if, if I pushed it back, my health would probably just get worse.\"\n\n### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING\n\n*   **Common Objections (General):** \"I don't have the money,\" \"Will it work for me?\", \"I'm not sure I should do it,\" \"Next year is better,\" \"I'll do it down the road,\" \"I need to think it over,\" \"I need to do more research,\" \"How much is it going to cost?\"\n*   **Specific Objection Handled:** \"Now's not a good time for us. We'll get back to you when we are interested. Keep in touch!\" (The \"Email Death\")\n*   **Recommended Response (via De-Framing & Identity Framing):** The speaker demonstrates *not* directly rebutting the objection, but rather asking questions to make the prospect self-persuade.\n    1.  **Permission & Concerned Tone:** \"Can I ask you something... without you getting upset with me?\" (This sets a non-confrontational, empathetic stage.)\n    2.  **Seed Doubt with Consequence Question:** \"How could I communicate to you that you might be making a mistake, without you getting upset with me?\"\n    3.  **Dig Deeper into Consequences:** Ask what will happen if they *don't* address the problem now (loss of energy, productivity, promotion, family impact, spouse's feelings).\n    4.  **Identity Reframe:** Contrast their current inaction with the identity of someone who fails to address similar issues, and their desired outcome with the identity of someone who takes action. This makes them *reject* the negative identity.\n\n*   **Reframe/Psychology:** The goal is to shift the prospect's internal frame from \"now is not a good time\" to \"if I don't act now, the consequences will be severe, and it goes against who I want to be.\" The salesperson uses a concerned tone to bypass resistance and plant seeds of doubt, leading the prospect to discover their own reasons for urgency and change.\n\n### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n1.  **Focus on Self-Persuasion:** Don't try to persuade prospects yourself; help them persuade themselves by identifying their pain and the fear of future pain.\n2.  **Uncover Deeper Consequences:** Go beyond superficial problems. Use layered \"Consequence Questions\" (\"And what happens then?\") to reveal the true, emotional impact of inaction on their life, business, and family.\n3.  **Leverage Emotional Drivers:** The two biggest emotional drivers for humans to want to change are **pain** and the **fear of future pain**. Tap into these effectively.\n4.  **Master the Concerned Tone for De-Framing:** Use a genuinely concerned tone when asking potentially uncomfortable questions. This seeds doubt, lowers their guard, and makes them open to considering they might be making a mistake, without getting defensive.\n5.  **Utilize Identity Framing:** Help prospects associate inaction with an undesirable identity (e.g., someone who gives up or lets problems fester) and action with an aspirational identity (e.g., a high-performer, a loving spouse, a successful leader).\n\n### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION\n\nThese techniques can be powerfully applied to selling Super Patch wellness products:\n\n*   **1. Identify Core Pain Points (from the prospect):**\n    *   Instead of just \"You need better sleep,\" dig into their actual experience: \"How has your sleep been lately?\" (Prospect: \"Terrible, I wake up exhausted.\")\n    *   \"How does that impact your day-to-day?\" (Prospect: \"I'm irritable with my kids, I can't focus at work, I drink too much coffee.\")\n    *   *For Pain Relief:* \"How does that knee pain limit what you can do?\" (Prospect: \"I can't play with my grandkids, I struggle at work, I miss out on hiking.\")\n\n*   **2. Apply Layered Consequence Questions (De-Framing):**\n    *   **Initial Delay:** Prospect says, \"I'll think about it\" or \"It sounds interesting, but I'm busy right now.\"\n    *   **Salesperson (Concerned Tone):** \"Can I ask you something, just between you and me? How could I share my concern that you might be missing out on a significant opportunity, without you getting annoyed with me?\"\n    *   *If Prospect says \"Sure\":*\n        *   **For Sleep:** \"You mentioned you wake up exhausted and are irritable with your kids. What are the consequences if you continue having poor sleep like this for the next 6-12 months? How does that impact your relationship with your family?\" (Prospect: \"It puts a strain on things, I feel guilty.\") \"And how does that impact your career, your focus and productivity at work?\" (Prospect: \"I'm falling behind, my boss is noticing.\") \"And what happens then, if your performance declines further?\" (Prospect: \"I could miss out on a promotion, or even risk my job.\")\n        *   **For Pain:** \"You said your knee pain stops you from playing with your grandkids. What are the long-term consequences if that pain continues to worsen, preventing you from being active with them as they grow up?\" (Prospect: \"I'd miss out on so many memories, I'd feel sad and regretful.\") \"And how does constant pain impact your mood and energy for everything else in your life?\" (Prospect: \"I'm always tired, grumpy, and feel like I'm aging faster.\")\n\n*   **3. Apply Identity Framing:**\n    *   *After digging deep into consequences for sleep issues:* \"For you, do you want to be someone who just accepts chronic fatigue and its impact on your family and career, or do you want to be the kind of person who actively seeks solutions to optimize their health and be fully present for their life and work?\"\n    *   *After uncovering pain consequences:* \"Do you want to be defined by your pain, letting it dictate what you can and can't do, like many people who just live with it? Or do you want to be someone who takes proactive steps to reclaim their physical freedom and enjoy life without limitations?\"\n\nBy following this process, the Super Patch salesperson guides the prospect to articulate *their own* reasons for needing the product *now*, shifting them from external objections to internal motivation driven by their deepest pains and aspirations."

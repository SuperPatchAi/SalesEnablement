## Study 1: RESTORE Pain Study (2025)

### Publication Details
- **Journal:** Pain Therapeutics (Pain Ther) - Peer Reviewed
- **Type:** Randomized, Controlled, Double-Blind Study
- **Registration:** ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06505005
- **Authors:** Janet Fason, Peter Hurwitz, Jeffrey Gudin (University of Miami Miller School of Medicine)

### Study Design
- **Participants:** 118 adults (58 male, 60 female)
- **Duration:** 14 days
- **Groups:** Active VTT patch (n=64) vs. Placebo patch (n=54)
- **Conditions:** Myofascial/musculoskeletal pain, arthritis, neuropathy/radiculopathy

### Key Findings
| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Pain Severity | Significantly greater improvement in active group |
| Pain Interference | Significantly greater reduction in active group |
| Range of Motion | Greater objective improvement at Day 7 and Day 14 |

### Assessment Tools
- Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) - validated instrument
- Schober's Test (lumbar spine flexibility)
- Goniometer measurements
- Bubble inclinometer measurements

### Clinical Implications
> "These findings suggest that this non-pharmacological, noninvasive, topical VTT haptic patch (FREEDOM Super Patch with VTT) can reduce pain severity and increase ROM/flexibility. Considering the multitude of serious adverse effects associated with standard pharmacological pain treatments, clinicians should consider this readily available, over-the-counter VTT patch as a potential first-line or adjunct therapy to treat pain."

## Study 2: HARMONI Sleep Study

### Publication Details
- **Study Name:** HARMONI Study
- **Type:** Prospective Clinical Trial
- **Product Tested:** REM Sleep Patch with VTT

### Study Design
- **Participants:** 113 adults (79 women, 34 men)
- **Average Age:** 53 years
- **Duration:** 14 days
- **Inclusion Criteria:** Adults with difficulty falling or staying asleep

### Key Findings

| Metric | Before | After 14 Days | Improvement |
|--------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Time to Fall Asleep | 69 minutes | 37 minutes | **46% faster** |
| Total Sleep Duration | 5 hours | 6.5 hours | **+1.5 hours** |
| Night Waking | 83% weekly | 22% weekly | **74% reduction** |
| Sleep Medication Use | Baseline | 80% stopped | **80% reduction** |

### Secondary Benefits Reported
- Reduced daytime fatigue
- Improved mood
- Better concentration
- Enhanced memory
- Improved ability to perform daily activities

### Safety Profile
- **Adverse Events:** Only 5 out of 113 participants (4.4%)
- **Nature:** Minor (mild itching, vivid dreams)
- **No serious adverse events reported**

### Patient Preference
- 90% reported easy to use and convenient
- 70% preferred patch over sleep medications

### Product: **REM Patch**

## Study 3: Balance & Stability Study (2022)

### Publication Details
- **Journal:** International Journal of Research in Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation
- **Type:** Controlled Comparative Study
- **Authors:** John Haddad (American University, Beirut), Baldeep S. Dhaliwal, Manny S. Dhaliwal, Peter Hurwitz

### Study Design
- **Participants:** 69 subjects (44 males, 25 females)
- **Method:** Sway Medical Balance Assessment
- **Comparison:** VTT-enhanced socks vs. regular socks
- **Statistical Analysis:** One-way ANOVA F test

### Key Findings
| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Mean Balance Score Improvement | **31% increase** |
| Statistical Significance | **p < 0.05** |

### Mechanism
VTT Enhanced products influence:
- Neuromuscular balance control centers
- Sensory processing areas
- Cognitive integration
- Musculoskeletal coordination

### Clinical Applications
- Fall prevention in elderly patients
- Balance rehabilitation
- Mobility improvement
- Activities of Daily Living (ADL) support

### Product: **LIBERTY Patch**

## Vibrotactile Technology (VTT) - Mechanism of Action

### Scientific Foundation
VTT is based on Nobel Prize-winning research (2021) on mechanoreceptors and Piezo channels:

1. **Mechanoreceptor Activation**
   - Specialized ridge patterns on patch surface
   - Interact with skin's mechanoreceptors (Meissner's corpuscles, Merkel cells)

2. **Piezo Channel Stimulation**
   - Piezo1 and Piezo2 ion channels respond to mechanical stimuli
   - Modulate neural signaling pathways

3. **Gate Control Theory Application**
   - A-beta nerve fiber activation
   - Inhibition of pain signal transmission from A-delta and C-fibers

4. **Neural Pathway Modulation**
   - Bidirectional communication with CNS
   - Targeted activation of specific neural responses

### Key Differentiators
| Feature | Traditional Patches | VTT Patches |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Drug Delivery | Transdermal chemicals | None |
| Mechanism | Chemical absorption | Neural stimulation |
| Side Effects | Possible | Minimal |
| Dependency Risk | Possible | None |
| Long-term Use | May have concerns | Safe for extended use |

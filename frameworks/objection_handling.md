Here's a structured analysis of the sales training video, tailored for a direct sales team selling Super Patch wellness products:

## VIDEO ANALYSIS

### 1. MAIN TOPIC & TECHNIQUE

The primary sales concept/technique being taught is **Conversation Aikido**. This technique focuses on deflecting objections and questions by understanding the underlying emotion/need and then guiding the conversation with open-ended questions, rather than directly answering or arguing.

### 2. KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

**Framework/Technique Name:** Conversation Aikido

**Step-by-step process:**

1.  **Receive the Statement/Objection:** The customer presents a statement, question, or objection (e.g., "Your product is too expensive," "You're always late").
2.  **Acknowledge and Understand (Don't Answer):** Instead of immediately providing an answer or counter-argument, the salesperson expresses understanding and paraphrases the customer's statement or the feeling behind it. The key is to convey empathy and show you've heard them.
3.  **Ask an Open-Ended Question:** Immediately follow the acknowledgment with an open-ended question designed to uncover the *real*, deeper issue, need, or interest driving their initial statement.

**The psychology/principle behind why it works:**

*   **Avoids "Stupidity" (Emotional Overload):** The speaker uses a brain model to illustrate that when emotions rise (e.g., due to feeling attacked or argued with), the logical thinking part of the brain "disconnects." Direct answers or arguments raise emotions, making the other person less receptive to logic. "The higher emotion goes, the lower thinking goes." (0:55, 2:43-3:00)
*   **Uncovers the Real Issue:** Surface-level objections (like "too expensive") are often not the true underlying problem. By avoiding a direct answer and instead asking an open question, you create an opportunity to discover what's *really* driving their hesitation, concern, or need. "When someone says your product is too expensive, that's not what their real issue is." (2:15-2:18)
*   **Uses Their Energy Against Them (Aikido):** Like in martial arts, where an opponent's force is used against them, Conversation Aikido uses the energy of the objection to move the conversation forward constructively. You "go towards the punch, dodge it, and look and you're seeing the world in the same direction as the person who's attacking you." (4:28-4:54)
*   **Fosters Connection and Trust:** By demonstrating active listening and a genuine desire to understand their perspective, you build rapport and trust. "I understand and accepting the energy that's coming from the other person and then giving back an open question." (7:00-7:08)
*   **Shuts Down Argumentation:** It prevents the conversation from devolving into a "no, it's not" debate, which yields no valuable information and damages the relationship. "By giving the answer, we shut down the possibility of hearing what's really going on." (6:23-6:29)

### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS

*   **General Opening Line for Understanding:** "I understand..." (3:39) or "I understand that..." (3:47)
*   **General Structure for Objection Response:** "I understand that [restate their point in your words or describe the emotion you infer]. [Open-ended question to uncover deeper need/interest]."

*   **Specific Objection Responses:**
    *   **"Your product is too expensive."** (0:05, 1:28, 2:15, 3:47, 5:44, 6:33)
        *   **Recommended Response:** "I understand that money is an important factor for you. What other criteria will be used in taking this decision?" (3:47-3:56)
        *   **Alternative/Refined:** "I understand that money is an important criteria for you. What other things are important in this decision?" (6:36-6:41)
    *   **"You're always late."** (0:17) (Used as a personal analogy)
        *   **Recommended Response:** "I understand you feel frustrated. I understand you feel let down." (5:10-5:14) (Note: The speaker emphasizes understanding the *feeling* here.)
    *   **"I'll have to speak to my boss."** (2:20, 6:43)
        *   **Recommended Response:** "Hey, this is an important decision, I understand you want to get everyone involved. When can I come and meet with you and your boss together?" (6:44-6:53) (Note: The speaker then self-corrects, implying a more open question might be better. The emphasis is on understanding *why* they need to consult the boss.)
    *   **General Inquiry to understand deeper issues:**
        *   "What can we do now?" (5:28)
        *   "What happened during the day?" (5:30)
        *   "What would you like to talk about?" (5:31)
        *   "What could we do this weekend?" (5:33)

### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING

*   **Common objections mentioned:**
    *   "It's quite expensive / Your product is too expensive."
    *   "You're always late." (Analogy)
    *   "You never wash the dishes." (Analogy)
    *   "I'll have to speak to my boss."
    *   "Your competitor is better."
    *   "You failed us three years ago."
    *   "I don't trust your company."

*   **Recommended responses (exact wording if provided):** See Section 3 above. The core is the "I understand + open question" structure.

*   **The reframe or psychology behind each response:** The goal is to move beyond the stated objection to uncover the customer's genuine needs, concerns, past experiences, decision-making criteria, and influencing factors, by inviting them to share more rather than shutting them down with a defensive answer. This approach keeps emotions low and encourages thoughtful, honest communication.

### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1.  **Don't Answer, Understand:** The fundamental rule is to resist the urge to directly answer questions or objections. Instead, listen, acknowledge, and seek to understand the underlying concern.
2.  **Use "I Understand" + Open Question:** Master the core "Conversation Aikido" technique: "I understand that [your interpretation of their point/feeling]. What [open-ended question to gain deeper insight]?"
3.  **Control Emotional Response:** Recognize that direct arguments increase emotion and decrease rational thinking. Your calm, understanding approach keeps the conversation productive.
4.  **Practice Consistently:** You have years of training to answer questions. It will take conscious, repeated practice (at least 18 years, as the speaker joked) to rewire this habit and effectively implement Conversation Aikido in the heat of the moment.
5.  **Seek the "Real Underlying Need":** The ultimate objective is to go beneath the surface to identify the customer's true needs, issues, interests, and decision-making drivers, which are rarely articulated in the initial objection.

### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION

Here's how these techniques can be specifically applied to selling Super Patch wellness products in a direct sales/network marketing context:

*   **Product Context:** Super Patch offers non-invasive, drug-free wellness solutions via patented vibrating patterns, often focusing on areas like pain relief, sleep, balance, and energy. Customers might be skeptical of the technology, price, or efficacy compared to traditional methods.

*   **Specific Examples:**

    1.  **Objection: "These patches seem too expensive for just a sticker."**
        *   **Conversation Aikido Response:** "I understand that the cost is an important consideration, and you want to ensure you're getting value for your investment. What specific health or wellness goals are you hoping to achieve, and what other factors are you weighing when considering a new solution?"
        *   **Psychology:** Acknowledges financial concern but immediately pivots to their personal health goals and broader decision criteria, moving beyond just the price tag to the *value* it might provide relative to their needs.

    2.  **Objection: "I've tried a lot of different supplements/remedies for my pain, and nothing seems to work. Why would Super Patch be different?"**
        *   **Conversation Aikido Response:** "I hear your frustration with past experiences, and it makes complete sense that you're cautious after trying so many things. Can you tell me a little more about what you've tried and what specifically you found disappointing or ineffective about them?"
        *   **Psychology:** Validates their skepticism and past negative experiences, building empathy. It then prompts them to elaborate, helping you understand their specific pain points and perhaps identify gaps in previous solutions that Super Patch might address.

    3.  **Objection: "I need to talk to my doctor before I try anything new like this."**
        *   **Conversation Aikido Response:** "I completely understand and respect your desire to consult with your doctor, as health decisions are always important. What specific questions or information do you think your doctor would need to evaluate Super Patch, or what concerns do you anticipate they might have?"
        *   **Psychology:** Reinforces their autonomy and caution, making them feel heard. It shifts the focus from a blanket deferral to specific, actionable information needed for the doctor, which you might be able to provide or help them frame.

    4.  **Objection: "How does a patch really help me sleep/have more energy? It sounds like magic."**
        *   **Conversation Aikido Response:** "I appreciate your curiosity about the science behind Super Patch, as it is a unique approach to wellness. What specifically about the 'how it works' aspect interests you most, or what makes you feel it might be 'magic'?"
        *   **Psychology:** Encourages them to voice their specific areas of disbelief or curiosity about the underlying technology. This allows you to provide targeted information or demonstrations rather than a generic explanation that might not address their core skepticism.

    5.  **Objection: "My friend tried it and didn't feel anything."**
        *   **Conversation Aikido Response:** "I hear that your friend's experience left you wondering if it would work for you, and personal experiences can certainly be influential. Can you tell me more about what your friend was hoping to achieve, and what their specific routine or expectations were when using the patch?"
        *   **Psychology:** Acknowledges the negative social proof but creates an opportunity to understand the context of the friend's experience (e.g., perhaps they used the wrong patch, for the wrong reason, or had unrealistic expectations). This helps prevent general dismissal based on limited information.

By consistently applying Conversation Aikido, your sales team can move beyond transactional responses to build deeper relationships, truly understand customer needs, and effectively position Super Patch as the right solution.

## 9 Minute Training To Destroy Any Sales Objection

**Source:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDWUpuumAuo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDWUpuumAuo)

Here's a structured analysis of the sales training video:

## VIDEO ANALYSIS

### 1. MAIN TOPIC & TECHNIQUE

The primary sales concept taught is **Prospect Self-Persuasion through De-framing Pain and Fear of Future Pain.** The core technique is **Consequence Questioning** delivered with a **Concerned Tone**, leading to **Identity Framing**, to encourage prospects to persuade *themselves* to change.

### 2. KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

**A. Understanding the Drivers for Change:**
*   **Principle:** Humans are driven to change by **pain** and the **fear of future pain**. If a prospect doesn't feel pain or fear of future pain related to their current situation, they see no need to change and will give objections.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Identify the prospect's current problems/pain points related to your product/service (even if seemingly superficial).
    2.  Use layered "Consequence Questions" to uncover the deeper, more significant impacts of these problems on their life, business, and relationships.

**B. De-Framing through Consequence Questioning & Concerned Tone:**
*   **Framework/Technique Name:** De-Framing with Consequence Questions (using a Concerned Tone)
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  Prospect expresses an objection or desire to delay. (e.g., "Now's not a good time for us, we'll get back to you.")
    2.  Salesperson uses a **concerned tone** and asks for permission to ask a direct, potentially uncomfortable question.
    3.  Salesperson asks a layered "Consequence Question" about the impact of *not* solving the problem, moving from immediate consequences to deeper, more significant ones (financial, relational, identity-based).
    4.  Salesperson continues to ask "And what happens then?" or "How does that impact X?" until the prospect fully articulates and *feels* the profound negative consequences of their inaction.
    5.  The concerned tone seeds doubt in the prospect's mind, lowering their guard and making them more open to considering their decision.

*   **Psychology/Principle:**
    *   **Consequence Questioning:** Forces the prospect to visualize and emotionally connect with the negative outcomes of maintaining their status quo or delaying action. It moves them from a logical, superficial objection to an emotional, deeper realization of potential loss.
    *   **Concerned Tone:** Projects empathy and genuine care, making the salesperson seem like an ally rather than an aggressive seller. This disarms the prospect, triggering doubt about their own decision without making them feel attacked. The prospect unconsciously feels the salesperson knows something they don't, which makes them more receptive.

**C. Identity Framing:**
*   **Framework/Technique Name:** Identity Framing
*   **Step-by-step process:**
    1.  Once the prospect is de-framed and has acknowledged the deep consequences of inaction (pain and fear of future pain), the salesperson introduces a question that contrasts their desired identity with the identity of someone who *fails* to address the problem.
    2.  The question makes the prospect choose between identifying with a negative, undesirable archetype (e.g., "executives who never get promoted because they neglect their health") and a positive, aspirational one (e.g., "someone who optimizes their health for peak performance").
*   **Psychology/Principle:** Humans are driven by who they believe themselves to be and who they aspire to be. By linking inaction to an undesirable identity and action to a desired one, the salesperson taps into a powerful intrinsic motivator. The prospect will want to *run away* from the negative identity and *run towards* the positive one, thus persuading themselves to buy.

### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS

*   **Common Objections/Frames (from 0:03-0:11):**
    *   "I don't have the money"
    *   "Will it work for me?"
    *   "I'm not sure I should do it"
    *   "Next year is better"
    *   "I'll do it down the road"
    *   "I need to think it over"
    *   "I need to do more research"
    *   "How much is it going to cost?"

*   **Email Death/Delay Response (from 0:31-0:39):**
    *   "Ah, we really liked you and what you had to say, but... now's not a good time for us. We'll get back to you when we are interested. Keep in touch!"

*   **Opening Consequence Question (general, from 1:18):**
    *   "And what are the consequences if they don't purchase your program?"

*   **Layered Consequence Questions (demonstrated by speaker with prospect on health consulting, from 1:23-1:57):**
    *   "Okay, and if they lose a lot of money and productivity, what's the consequences? Like, what happens then?"
    *   "Uh, their business won't make as much money and won't perform as well."
    *   "And what happens to the business then, when it doesn't perform?"
    *   "Probably won't be around much longer."
    *   "And what happens then when it goes out of business?"
    *   "Uh, they'll probably be busking outside the casino." (Speaker clarifies: "No, no seriously, I mean, on a serious note, like what happens to the business owner when they go under?")
    *   "Uh, not good things."
    *   "Like what, tell me."
    *   "Uh, they'll be unemployed."
    *   "Okay, and they're not making any money, what happens to their family?"
    *   "Can't provide for the family, yeah." (Speaker: "It's much deeper than just fixing their health.")

*   **De-Framing Question with Concerned Tone (from 3:08 and 5:50):**
    *   "Can I, hey, can I um, can I ask you something and you can always get back to me down the road, can I can I ask you something?"
    *   *Prospect:* "Sure."
    *   *Salesperson:* (Concerned Tone) "How um... how could I communicate to you that you might be making a mistake, without you getting upset with me?"
    *   *Self-Correction Example (from 5:50):* "Yeah, not a problem. Um, can I, can I ask you something before I, you always call, call me in a couple months. Can I ask you something before I, before I head out?"
    *   *Prospect:* "Oh, no, I don't really have time, mate, sorry."
    *   *Salesperson:* "Well, yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't want to get you angry at me. I guess the question I had for you, and like I said, you always get back to me. How, how can I communicate to you, that, that you might be making a mistake, without you getting upset with me?"

*   **Identity Frame Question (demonstrated from 7:00-7:40):**
    *   *Salesperson:* "I mean, how does your spouse feel about it though? Like, does your spouse, like, does she want you to keep having these issues where you like having a hard time even performing at work? Like, does she want you to have to keep going through that?"
    *   *Prospect:* "Nah, she's pretty pissed at me."
    *   *Salesperson:* "How do you mean by pissed?"
    *   *Prospect:* "Uh, she's probably, probably not happy with me."
    *   *Salesperson:* "Okay. I don't want, I don't want you sleeping on the couch tonight, man. But, but, but in all seriousness. Does she want you to get your health back so you can really get promoted into that CEO role, so you can make more money for the family? Or what does she want you to do?"
    *   *Prospect:* "Yeah, she would love that."
    *   *Salesperson:* "Okay. But why now? Like, why, why look at doing this now? Like, why not, you know, push it down the road like a lot of executives do, who end up never fixing their health and they never get promoted?"
    *   *Prospect:* "Yeah, if, if I pushed it back, my health would probably just get worse."

### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING

*   **Common Objections (General):** "I don't have the money," "Will it work for me?", "I'm not sure I should do it," "Next year is better," "I'll do it down the road," "I need to think it over," "I need to do more research," "How much is it going to cost?"
*   **Specific Objection Handled:** "Now's not a good time for us. We'll get back to you when we are interested. Keep in touch!" (The "Email Death")
*   **Recommended Response (via De-Framing & Identity Framing):** The speaker demonstrates *not* directly rebutting the objection, but rather asking questions to make the prospect self-persuade.
    1.  **Permission & Concerned Tone:** "Can I ask you something... without you getting upset with me?" (This sets a non-confrontational, empathetic stage.)
    2.  **Seed Doubt with Consequence Question:** "How could I communicate to you that you might be making a mistake, without you getting upset with me?"
    3.  **Dig Deeper into Consequences:** Ask what will happen if they *don't* address the problem now (loss of energy, productivity, promotion, family impact, spouse's feelings).
    4.  **Identity Reframe:** Contrast their current inaction with the identity of someone who fails to address similar issues, and their desired outcome with the identity of someone who takes action. This makes them *reject* the negative identity.

*   **Reframe/Psychology:** The goal is to shift the prospect's internal frame from "now is not a good time" to "if I don't act now, the consequences will be severe, and it goes against who I want to be." The salesperson uses a concerned tone to bypass resistance and plant seeds of doubt, leading the prospect to discover their own reasons for urgency and change.

### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1.  **Focus on Self-Persuasion:** Don't try to persuade prospects yourself; help them persuade themselves by identifying their pain and the fear of future pain.
2.  **Uncover Deeper Consequences:** Go beyond superficial problems. Use layered "Consequence Questions" ("And what happens then?") to reveal the true, emotional impact of inaction on their life, business, and family.
3.  **Leverage Emotional Drivers:** The two biggest emotional drivers for humans to want to change are **pain** and the **fear of future pain**. Tap into these effectively.
4.  **Master the Concerned Tone for De-Framing:** Use a genuinely concerned tone when asking potentially uncomfortable questions. This seeds doubt, lowers their guard, and makes them open to considering they might be making a mistake, without getting defensive.
5.  **Utilize Identity Framing:** Help prospects associate inaction with an undesirable identity (e.g., someone who gives up or lets problems fester) and action with an aspirational identity (e.g., a high-performer, a loving spouse, a successful leader).

### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION

These techniques can be powerfully applied to selling Super Patch wellness products:

*   **1. Identify Core Pain Points (from the prospect):**
    *   Instead of just "You need better sleep," dig into their actual experience: "How has your sleep been lately?" (Prospect: "Terrible, I wake up exhausted.")
    *   "How does that impact your day-to-day?" (Prospect: "I'm irritable with my kids, I can't focus at work, I drink too much coffee.")
    *   *For Pain Relief:* "How does that knee pain limit what you can do?" (Prospect: "I can't play with my grandkids, I struggle at work, I miss out on hiking.")

*   **2. Apply Layered Consequence Questions (De-Framing):**
    *   **Initial Delay:** Prospect says, "I'll think about it" or "It sounds interesting, but I'm busy right now."
    *   **Salesperson (Concerned Tone):** "Can I ask you something, just between you and me? How could I share my concern that you might be missing out on a significant opportunity, without you getting annoyed with me?"
    *   *If Prospect says "Sure":*
        *   **For Sleep:** "You mentioned you wake up exhausted and are irritable with your kids. What are the consequences if you continue having poor sleep like this for the next 6-12 months? How does that impact your relationship with your family?" (Prospect: "It puts a strain on things, I feel guilty.") "And how does that impact your career, your focus and productivity at work?" (Prospect: "I'm falling behind, my boss is noticing.") "And what happens then, if your performance declines further?" (Prospect: "I could miss out on a promotion, or even risk my job.")
        *   **For Pain:** "You said your knee pain stops you from playing with your grandkids. What are the long-term consequences if that pain continues to worsen, preventing you from being active with them as they grow up?" (Prospect: "I'd miss out on so many memories, I'd feel sad and regretful.") "And how does constant pain impact your mood and energy for everything else in your life?" (Prospect: "I'm always tired, grumpy, and feel like I'm aging faster.")

*   **3. Apply Identity Framing:**
    *   *After digging deep into consequences for sleep issues:* "For you, do you want to be someone who just accepts chronic fatigue and its impact on your family and career, or do you want to be the kind of person who actively seeks solutions to optimize their health and be fully present for their life and work?"
    *   *After uncovering pain consequences:* "Do you want to be defined by your pain, letting it dictate what you can and can't do, like many people who just live with it? Or do you want to be someone who takes proactive steps to reclaim their physical freedom and enjoy life without limitations?"

By following this process, the Super Patch salesperson guides the prospect to articulate *their own* reasons for needing the product *now*, shifting them from external objections to internal motivation driven by their deepest pains and aspirations.

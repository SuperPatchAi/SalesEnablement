## How Super Patch Works

### Vibrotactile Technology (VTT)

Super Patch uses a proprietary technology based on **neuroscience principles**:

1. **Specialized Ridge Patterns** - Each patch features unique, raised contours designed to stimulate specific neural responses
2. **Skin-Neural Connection** - The patterns interact with mechanoreceptors in the skin
3. **Neural Signal Activation** - Triggers the body's own response mechanisms
4. **Targeted Benefits** - Each pattern is designed for specific wellness outcomes

**Think of it as "Braille for your body"** - the patterns communicate with your nervous system through touch.

### Application:
1. Clean and dry the application area
2. Peel the patch from the backing
3. Press firmly onto skin (arm, leg, or torso)
4. Wear for up to 24 hours
5. Replace with new patch as needed

## Common Objections & Responses

### "Does it really work?"

**Response:** "Super Patch has been clinically studied and thousands of customers have experienced real results. The technology works by stimulating your body's own neural responses - it's like acupressure in a patch. Would you like to try it for yourself?"

### "How can a patch work without drugs?"

**Response:** "Great question! The patches use raised patterns that communicate with nerve receptors in your skin - similar to how braille works for reading. Your nervous system responds to these patterns naturally. No drugs needed because we're working with your body's own systems."

### "It seems too good to be true"

**Response:** "I understand that skepticism. That's why Super Patch offers a satisfaction guarantee. The technology is based on neuroscience principles, and we have clinical studies backing our claims. Why not try it and see for yourself?"

### "It's too expensive"

**Response:** "I understand. Let's break it down - each patch lasts up to 24 hours, and when you compare it to daily supplements, medications, or other treatments, it's actually very cost-effective. Plus, there are no side effects to worry about. What's it worth to you to [solve their pain point]?"

### "I need to think about it"

"Good morning, this is [Your Name] from Super Patch. I'm reaching out to practitioners who see patients with stress and anxiety and might be interested in a drug-free approach.

Our Peace patch uses Vibrotactile Technology to support calm through neural pathway activation – it's not sedating, so patients maintain function while experiencing relief.

Do you have patients who need stress support but aren't candidates for anxiolytic medications or want non-pharmaceutical options?

[Listen]

Would it be helpful if I sent information on how VTT supports calming pathways and how practitioners are using Peace?"

### 2. Email Introduction Script

**Subject:** Non-Sedating Drug-Free Stress Support for Your Patients

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION SCRIPT (2-Minute)

**(Problem-Agitate-Solve-Evidence Framework)**

**(PROBLEM)**

"Stress and anxiety have reached epidemic levels – affecting virtually every patient you see. But the treatment options create difficult tradeoffs.

Benzodiazepines work but carry dependency risk, sedation, and withdrawal concerns. SSRIs require daily dosing and have their own side effect profile. And 'just practice stress management' isn't enough when patients are overwhelmed."

**(AGITATE)**

"This puts you in a challenging position. Patients are suffering, their stress is driving or worsening other conditions, and the pharmaceutical options feel too heavy for many presentations.

Meanwhile, your patients with mild-moderate stress don't warrant medication but desperately need support. They need to function at work, drive, care for families – sedation isn't acceptable."

**(SOLVE)**

"That's why Peace is such a valuable tool. It supports calm through Vibrotactile Technology – activating parasympathetic and calming neural pathways without sedation or cognitive impairment.

There's nothing going into the body, no GABA manipulation, no serotonin effects. Patients experience calm while maintaining full function. They can use it as-needed without dependency concerns or withdrawal."

**(EVIDENCE)**

"The science foundation is mechanoreceptor research that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine. The nervous system has calming pathways that can be activated through sensory input.

For your patients, this means stress support without the tradeoffs of pharmaceutical intervention. For your practice, it means filling the gap between 'nothing' and 'medication' for the many patients who need help but don't warrant prescriptions.

Would you like to integrate Peace into your stress management protocols?"

***

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### 1. "Real anxiety disorders require proper treatment."

**Response:** "I completely agree – clinical anxiety disorders need comprehensive care. Peace isn't meant to treat disorders.

It's valuable for the majority of stress presentations that don't warrant diagnosis – the overwhelmed patients, the situational stress, the people who need support but not medication. Does that population represent a significant part of your practice?"

### 2. "How can a patch reduce anxiety?"

**Response:** "Good question. The mechanism is neural pathway activation through mechanoreceptors connected to calming systems – parasympathetic activation and stress regulation pathways.

It's working with the nervous system's natural calming capacity rather than adding pharmaceuticals. Would understanding the mechanism in more detail be helpful?"

### 3. "My patients expect immediate, powerful relief."

**Response:** "That expectation is often set by benzodiazepines – and it comes with dependency risk. Peace provides gentler support that patients can use safely.

Setting expectations for 'supportive calm' rather than 'knockout sedation' leads to appropriate use and better outcomes. How do you typically manage anxiety treatment expectations?"

### 4. "What about patients with severe anxiety?"

**Response:** "Severe anxiety may need pharmaceutical intervention – that's your clinical judgment. Peace isn't replacing that.

For mild-moderate presentations, transition support, or as adjunct to medication tapering, Peace provides drug-free support. Would that application be valuable for your practice?"

### 5. "I already recommend meditation and breathing techniques."

**Response:** "Those are excellent and foundational. Peace can complement them – supporting calm while patients build those skills.

Many patients struggle to meditate or breathe effectively when they're highly stressed. Peace provides baseline support that makes those practices more accessible. Does that layered approach make sense?"

### 6. "How long does the effect last?"

**Response:** "Effects vary by individual, but patients typically experience support throughout wear time. It can be used continuously or as-needed.

Unlike medications with half-lives and rebound, Peace provides gentle ongoing support while worn. For patients who need consistent support, it's sustainable long-term. Would that flexibility be valuable?"

### 7. "Natural supplements already fill this space."

**Response:** "Supplements like ashwagandha or L-theanine can be helpful, but they require ingestion, have variable efficacy, and some have interaction concerns.

Peace works through a completely different mechanism – neural pathway activation – and can be used alongside or instead of supplements. It's another tool in your toolkit. How satisfied are you with supplement options for stress?"

### 8. "Patients might use this to avoid addressing underlying issues."

**Response:** "That's a fair concern. Peace is supportive, not masking – patients still feel motivated to address stress sources.

Think of it as enabling rather than avoiding. When patients are less overwhelmed, they're more capable of engaging with therapy, lifestyle changes, and root cause work. Does that framing resonate?"

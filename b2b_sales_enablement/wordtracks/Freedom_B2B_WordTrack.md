## 1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW (Clinical Focus)

**Freedom** is Super Patch's flagship pain relief solution, providing drug-free, non-invasive relief for minor aches, pains, and discomfort. Utilizing cutting-edge **Vibrotactile Technology (VTT)**, each patch features specialized ridge patterns that interact with the skin's mechanoreceptors – the same pathways recognized by the **2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine** for discoveries in touch and temperature sensing.

### Clinical Mechanism of Action

Freedom's VTT works through multiple evidence-based mechanisms:

1. **Mechanoreceptor Activation:** Specialized ridge patterns stimulate Meissner's corpuscles and Merkel cells in the skin
2. **Piezo Channel Stimulation:** Piezo1 and Piezo2 ion channels respond to mechanical stimuli, modulating neural signaling pathways
3. **Gate Control Theory Application:** A-beta nerve fiber activation inhibits pain signal transmission from A-delta and C-fibers
4. **Neural Pathway Modulation:** Bidirectional communication with CNS enables targeted activation of pain-relief responses

### RESTORE Clinical Study (2025) - Key Evidence

| Study Detail | Data |
|--------------|------|
| **Publication** | Pain Therapeutics (Peer-Reviewed) |
| **Study Type** | Randomized, Controlled, Double-Blind |
| **Registration** | ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06505005 |
| **Participants** | 118 adults (58 male, 60 female) |
| **Duration** | 14 days |
| **Conditions** | Myofascial/musculoskeletal pain, arthritis, neuropathy |

**Key Findings:**
- Significantly greater improvement in pain severity vs. placebo
- Significantly greater reduction in pain interference
- Greater objective improvement in Range of Motion at Day 7 and Day 14
- Assessment using validated Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) instrument

**Clinical Conclusion:**
> "These findings suggest that this non-pharmacological, noninvasive, topical VTT haptic patch can reduce pain severity and increase ROM/flexibility. Clinicians should consider this readily available, over-the-counter VTT patch as a potential first-line or adjunct therapy to treat pain."

## 3. OPENING SCRIPTS

Building rapport with healthcare practitioners requires a professional, evidence-focused approach. Lead with clinical value, not sales pressure.

### 1. Cold Call Script

**Scenario:** Calling a chiropractic office for the first time.

"Good morning, this is [Your Name] from Super Patch. I'm reaching out to practitioners who are looking for evidence-based, drug-free pain relief options for their patients.

We have a clinical study published in Pain Therapeutics showing significant pain reduction and improved range of motion with our VTT patches – it's a double-blind, placebo-controlled study registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.

Many chiropractors are using our Freedom patch as a take-home support option between adjustments. Do you currently have a drug-free solution you recommend for patients with chronic pain who can't or don't want to use NSAIDs?

[Listen for response]

Would it be helpful if I sent over the clinical study abstract and set up a brief call with the doctor to discuss how this might fit into their practice?"

**Key Elements:** Lead with evidence, identify gap, offer value-first follow-up.

***

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION SCRIPT (2-Minute)

**(Problem-Agitate-Solve-Evidence Framework)**

**(PROBLEM)**

"Pain management is one of the biggest challenges in healthcare today. Your patients are caught between two difficult options: NSAIDs with gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks, or prescription medications with dependency concerns and side effect profiles that make long-term use problematic.

For many practitioners like yourself, the gap in effective, drug-free pain solutions means patients either suffer in silence, over-rely on medications, or lose compliance with your treatment plan because they can't manage their pain between visits."

**(AGITATE)**

"This isn't just a clinical problem – it affects outcomes. Patients in chronic pain don't exercise. They don't follow through on rehabilitation. They don't show up feeling their best. And when they turn to OTC medications repeatedly, they're accumulating risks you have to manage.

Meanwhile, the alternative health space has been flooded with unproven products that make claims without evidence, making patients skeptical and practitioners hesitant to recommend anything new."

**(SOLVE)**

"That's why I'm excited to share the Super Patch Freedom. It's a completely drug-free, non-invasive approach to pain relief using Vibrotactile Technology. Patients simply apply a small patch to their skin, and the specialized ridge patterns interact with mechanoreceptors – the same pathways that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine.

There's nothing going into the body. No chemicals, no transdermal drugs, no systemic absorption. It works by activating the body's own neural responses to modulate pain signals through gate control mechanisms."

**(EVIDENCE)**

"But here's what sets Freedom apart: we have clinical evidence. The RESTORE study, published in Pain Therapeutics, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 118 participants. It showed:
- Significant pain severity reduction versus placebo
- Significant reduction in pain interference with daily activities
- Measurable improvement in Range of Motion at Day 7 and Day 14

This isn't anecdotal – it's peer-reviewed, ClinicalTrials.gov registered evidence. For your practice, this means you can confidently recommend a drug-free option backed by real data.

Would you like me to send you the full study so you can review the methodology yourself?"

***

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING (Conversation Aikido)

Remember: Acknowledge, Validate, Redirect with an Open Question. Integrate clinical evidence where relevant.

### 1. "Patches for pain? That sounds too simple to work."

**Response:** "I completely understand that healthy skepticism – if I heard 'patch for pain relief' without context, I'd be skeptical too. That's exactly why we invested in clinical research.

The RESTORE study was specifically designed to address that skepticism – double-blind, placebo-controlled, published in Pain Therapeutics, registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. The results showed significant pain reduction and improved range of motion versus placebo.

What would you need to see in the research to feel confident that the mechanism is legitimate?"

**Psychology:** Validates skepticism, leads with evidence, empowers them to define their proof requirements.

### 2. "I need to see more clinical evidence before recommending this to patients."

**Response:** "I appreciate that evidence-based approach – it's exactly what good practitioners should require. We have the RESTORE study I mentioned, and the underlying technology is based on mechanoreceptor research that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine.

What specific aspects of clinical evidence would be most important for you – sample size, study design, specific outcome measures, or peer-review publication standards?"

**Psychology:** Validates their standards, offers existing evidence, identifies specific evidence criteria.

### 3. "My patients are skeptical of anything that isn't a pill or medication."

**Response:** "That's a fair concern, and patient acceptance is crucial. Interestingly, many practitioners find the opposite – patients who are tired of medications are actively seeking alternatives.

When you present Freedom as 'clinically studied, drug-free, and based on Nobel Prize-winning research,' it positions differently than typical wellness products. How do your patients typically respond when you recommend evidence-based alternatives to medication?"

**Psychology:** Reframes patient perception, provides positioning language, explores their experience.

### 4. "How can I justify the cost to patients compared to OTC pain relievers?"

**Response:** "I understand cost comparison is important for patient conversations. The value proposition is different though – a bottle of NSAIDs might cost less, but it comes with cumulative GI risks and doesn't address why patients sought your care in the first place.

Freedom offers drug-free relief that aligns with your holistic approach, has no contraindications, and supports the treatment plan you've developed. What value do your patients place on avoiding medication side effects?"

**Psychology:** Shifts from price to value, reinforces practitioner's care philosophy.

### 5. "We've tried other patches/products and patients didn't see results."

**Response:** "I appreciate you sharing that experience – it makes sense to be cautious after disappointing results. Can I ask what types of patches or products those were, and what specifically patients felt was missing?

What makes Freedom different is the VTT mechanism and the clinical evidence behind it. Most patches either deliver a substance transdermally or are simply placebo. We have a double-blind study showing Freedom outperformed placebo significantly. Would reviewing that comparison data be helpful?"

**Psychology:** Validates past experience, differentiates Freedom, offers proof of difference.

### 6. "I don't want to sell products – I'm a healthcare practitioner, not a salesperson."

**Response:** "I completely respect that – your focus should be on patient care, not retail. Many practitioners feel the same way initially.

The way most of our practitioners approach it is as a recommendation, not a sale. They recommend Freedom the same way they'd recommend a supplement or home care routine. Patients can purchase through you at practitioner pricing, or you can simply provide the information and let them purchase directly.

Would a recommendation-only approach feel more aligned with your practice style?"

**Psychology:** Validates concern, offers alternative positioning, provides flexible options.

### 7. "What about liability if a patient has a reaction?"

**Response:** "That's a thoughtful question that shows you prioritize patient safety. Freedom is FDA-listed as a Class 1 medical device, which is the lowest-risk category. The RESTORE study showed an excellent safety profile with no serious adverse events.

Because there's nothing going into the body – no drugs, no chemicals – the contraindication and interaction concerns you'd have with pharmaceuticals simply don't apply. What specific safety information would give you confidence?"

**Psychology:** Validates safety concern, provides regulatory context, emphasizes mechanism safety.

### 8. "I'm too busy to add something new to my practice."

**Response:** "I understand completely – practice demands are real, and time is your most valuable resource. The practitioners who've had the most success actually find Freedom saves time.

Instead of lengthy conversations about pain medication alternatives or managing patients frustrated by lack of options, they can recommend a single evidence-backed solution. Would a 10-minute overview call work better than trying to evaluate this on your own?"

**Psychology:** Acknowledges time constraints, repositions as time-saver, offers efficient next step.

## 7. CLOSING SCRIPTS

Before any close, use the "Loop" to surface remaining concerns:

**You:** "Do you have any other questions about the clinical evidence or how practitioners are using Freedom?"
**Practitioner:** [Responds]
**You:** "Does everything we've discussed make sense for your practice?"
**Practitioner:** [Responds – may reveal final buying-motivated question]

### 1. The Clinical Confidence Close

"Based on the clinical evidence from the RESTORE study and the fit we've discussed for your pain patients, would you like to set up a practitioner account so you can trial Freedom with a few appropriate patients and evaluate the results firsthand?"

**When to use:** After discussing clinical evidence thoroughly.

### 2. The Patient Gap Close

"You mentioned that [specific patient type, e.g., 'elderly patients with multiple medications' or 'athletes who can't use NSAIDs'] are a challenge for pain management. Freedom addresses exactly that gap with zero drug interactions.

Shall we set up your practitioner account so you have this option available when those patients present?"

**When to use:** After identifying specific patient population needs.

### 3. The Pilot Program Close

"Rather than committing to a large order, many practitioners start with a pilot approach – select 5-10 patients who fit the profile, recommend Freedom, and evaluate results over 30 days.

Would you like to start with a pilot program to see how your patients respond before making a larger commitment?"

**When to use:** With hesitant practitioners who want proof in their own practice.

### 4. The Competitive Advantage Close

"More patients are actively seeking drug-free alternatives, and practitioners who can offer evidence-based solutions are differentiating their practices.

Would positioning your practice as offering clinically-studied, non-pharmaceutical pain relief be valuable for patient acquisition and retention?"

**When to use:** With business-minded practitioners focused on practice growth.

### 5. The Referral Network Close

"Given your connections with other practitioners in the area, if Freedom works well for your patients, I'd love to eventually get your referrals to colleagues who might benefit similarly.

Let's start with your account and see how your patients respond. What's the best way to get you set up today?"

**When to use:** After establishing good rapport and practitioner seems well-connected.

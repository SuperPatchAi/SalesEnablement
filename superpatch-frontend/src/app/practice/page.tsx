    response:
      "I understand cost is important. Consider this: many customers find that one patch can replace multiple products they're currently using - supplements, creams, or medications. At about $3 per day, it's often less than their morning coffee. Plus, with our 30-day guarantee, there's zero risk to try it.",

    response:
      "That's a fair question! Our Freedom patch is backed by the RESTORE study - a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with 118 participants. It showed statistically significant improvements in pain and range of motion. Would you like me to share the specifics?",

    category: "Skepticism",
  },
  {
    id: "3",
    objection: "I've tried patches before and they didn't work.",
    response:
      "I hear that often. Traditional patches use drugs or chemicals that absorb through skin. SuperPatch is completely different - it uses Vibrotactile Technology that works with your nervous system through touch receptors. No drugs enter your body. It's a whole new category of wellness.",
    productId: "all",
    category: "Skepticism",
  },
  {
    id: "4",
    objection: "I need to think about it.",
    response:
      "Absolutely, take your time. While you're thinking, consider this: we have a 30-day money-back guarantee. So you can try it risk-free for a month. If it doesn't work for you, just send it back. What questions can I answer to help with your decision?",

    category: "Stall",
  },
  {
    id: "5",
    objection: "My doctor hasn't recommended this.",
    response:
      "That makes sense - many doctors aren't yet familiar with VTT technology. The great news is SuperPatch is 100% drug-free and has zero interactions with medications. Many of our customers share their results with their doctors afterwards. Would clinical study information help?",

    category: "Authority",

    objection: "I already take medication for sleep.",
    response:
      "Many of our REM patch users started in the same situation. In our HARMONI study, 80% of participants actually stopped using their sleep medications during the trial. REM works differently - it supports your body's natural sleep patterns without any drugs. It can be used alongside medications while you transition.",

    category: "Competition",

  {
    id: "7",
    objection: "My patients won't believe in patches.",
    response:
      "I understand that concern. What we've found is that results speak louder than explanations. Many practitioners start by trying it themselves, then with a few open-minded patients. Once they see results - like 46% faster sleep onset or significant pain reduction - the conversations become much easier.",

    objection: "We don't have budget for new wellness initiatives right now.",
    response:
      "I completely understand budget constraints. Here's what's interesting: studies show poor sleep and chronic pain cost employers $1,967 per employee annually in lost productivity. A pilot program with SuperPatch typically costs a fraction of that, with measurable ROI within 90 days.",

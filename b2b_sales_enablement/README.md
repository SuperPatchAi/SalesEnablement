## Clinical Evidence Summary

### Products with Direct Clinical Studies

| Product | Study | Key Finding |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Freedom** | RESTORE RCT (2025) | Significant pain reduction vs. placebo, improved ROM |
| **REM** | HARMONI Study | 46% faster sleep, 80% stopped medications |
| **Liberty** | Balance Study (2022) | 31% improvement in balance scores |

### All Products Use VTT Technology

All Super Patch products use **Vibrotactile Technology (VTT)** based on:
- Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research (2021)
- Piezo channel activation
- Neural pathway modulation
- Gate control theory principles

Each B2B Word Track includes:

1. **Product Overview (Clinical Focus)** - Mechanism, clinical data, practice benefits
2. **Ideal Practitioner Profile** - Target practitioners, pain points
3. **Opening Scripts** - Cold calls, emails, referrals, events
4. **Discovery Questions** - Practice-focused needs assessment
5. **Product Presentation** - 2-3 minute clinical pitch
6. **Objection Handling** - Evidence-based responses with clinical data
7. **Closing Scripts** - Partnership-focused closes
8. **Follow-up Sequences** - Professional email/call cadences

## Key Differentiators from D2C Sales

| Aspect | D2C (Consumer) | B2B (Practitioner) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Language** | Benefits, emotions | Clinical evidence, outcomes |
| **Proof** | Testimonials | Peer-reviewed studies |
| **Value Prop** | Personal relief | Patient outcomes + revenue |
| **Objections** | Skepticism, cost | Clinical evidence, integration |
| **Relationship** | Transactional | Partnership |
| **Timeline** | Immediate decision | Consultative process |

## Objection Handling with Clinical Evidence

### Universal Clinical Objection Responses

**"I need to see clinical evidence."**
> "We have peer-reviewed publications including the RESTORE study (Pain Therapeutics, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06505005) and HARMONI study. The Balance & Stability study is published in Int J Res Phys Med Rehabil. Let me send you the full studies."

**"How can a patch work without drugs?"**
> "VTT works through mechanoreceptor activation – the same science that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine. Piezo1 and Piezo2 channels respond to mechanical stimulation and modulate neural signaling. No substances enter the body; we're optimizing the nervous system's own pathways."

**"Is there placebo-controlled data?"**
> "Yes. The RESTORE study was randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled. Both groups received identical-looking patches. The VTT group showed statistically significant improvements in pain severity, interference, and objective ROM measurements."

**"My patients have tried patches before."**
> "Most patches deliver substances transdermally. VTT is fundamentally different – nothing enters the body. It's mechanoreceptor-mediated neural modulation. The mechanism is completely distinct from transdermal delivery systems."

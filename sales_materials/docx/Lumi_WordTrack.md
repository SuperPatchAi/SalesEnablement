## 1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW

Lumi is a revolutionary beauty patch designed to help individuals achieve healthier, more radiant skin naturally. It's not a topical cream or a supplement; instead, Lumi utilizes Super Patch's innovative Vibrotactile Technology (VTT). This means specialized ridge patterns on the patch interact gently with the skin's mechanoreceptors, triggering the body's own neural responses to support skin appearance, enhance complexion, and provide overall beauty support.

For anyone seeking to complement their healthy lifestyle with enhanced skin care, Lumi offers a unique, non-invasive, 100% drug-free, and all-natural solution. It's for those who want to feel more confident and vibrant in their skin without relying on harsh chemicals or complex routines. Lumi simplifies beauty support, allowing your body to work with its natural intelligence for a truly radiant glow.

What makes Lumi truly unique is its foundational science – Vibrotactile Technology. Unlike traditional beauty products that apply ingredients to the skin or are ingested, Lumi works *with* your body's inherent systems. This innovative approach means you're not introducing external substances but rather activating your body's own capacity for beauty support, offering a gentle yet powerful pathway to a more luminous complexion.

## 3. OPENING SCRIPTS

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION SCRIPT (2-Minute Problem-Agitate-Solve)

**(Problem):** "Many people I speak with are looking for that natural, healthy glow, but they're often frustrated. They've tried countless creams, serums, and even supplements, only to find their skin still looks dull, uneven, or just not as vibrant as they'd like. Some are even sensitive to all the chemicals in topical products, or they just don't have the time for complex routines."

**(Agitate):** "It's disheartening when you invest time and money into products that don't deliver. That feeling of looking in the mirror and not seeing the radiant skin you want can really impact your confidence, making you feel less vibrant and sometimes even self-conscious. You deserve a solution that genuinely supports your natural beauty, without adding more complexity or worry to your life."

**(Solve):** "That's exactly why I'm so excited about Lumi. It's a completely different approach. Instead of putting things *on* or *in* your body, Lumi uses our unique Vibrotactile Technology – specialized patterns on a small patch that gently interact with your skin. This naturally triggers your body's own neural responses to support skin appearance, enhance your radiant complexion, and provide overall beauty support. It's 100% drug-free, all-natural, and non-invasive. Think of it as activating your body's inherent intelligence for beauty, giving you that healthy, luminous glow from within. It’s simple, effective, and works *with* your body, not against it. Many people feel a difference in their skin's vibrancy and texture, often within a few weeks."

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

*(Apply Conversation Aikido: Acknowledge and Understand + Redirect with an Open Question)*

**1. "It's too expensive."**
"I understand that cost is an important factor when you're considering new wellness solutions, and you want to make a smart investment. What other criteria are most important for you when evaluating the value of a product that supports your skin's health and appearance?"

**2. "I need to think about it."**
"I completely understand that this is a decision you want to feel good about, and it's important to take your time. What specific questions or considerations are coming up for you as you think it over that I might be able to help clarify?"

**3. "I need to talk to my spouse."**
"I understand this is a significant decision for your health and well-being, and you want to ensure it's the right fit for your household. What specific questions or concerns do you anticipate your spouse might have that we could address together?"

**4. "Does it really work? It sounds too good to be true."**
"I completely understand why you might be skeptical about new technologies, and it's important to feel confident in your choices. What would you need to see, hear, or experience to truly feel that Lumi is a credible solution for you?"

**5. "I've tried patches/products before, and they haven't worked."**
"I understand you've had experiences with other products in the past, and it can be frustrating when they don't deliver. What did you like or dislike about those previous products, and what were you hoping they would achieve for your skin?"

**6. "I'm not interested."**
"I understand that you might not be actively looking for new solutions right now, and I respect that. Just out of curiosity, what has led you to feel that way about beauty and wellness products in general?" (If they give a generic answer or seem truly closed, gracefully pivot or thank them for their time. If they open up, you might find a hidden need.)

**7. "I don't have time."**
"I completely understand, life can get incredibly busy, and adding another thing to your routine might seem daunting. What aspects of your current skincare or wellness routine do you find most time-consuming, and what kind of time commitment would make a new solution truly appealing to you?"

**8. "How is this different from [competitor/topical cream]?"**
"That's a great question, and I understand you're looking for what makes Lumi unique. What have you found most appealing or effective about [competitor/topical cream], and what, if anything, are you hoping to find that it might not be providing?"

## 7. CLOSING SCRIPTS

*(Remember the 5-Step Closing Framework: Proactively overcome objections, sprinkle "Do you have any questions?" throughout, use the "Loop" before the close ("Any questions for me?" then "Does this all make sense?"), then Close, and have a Backup Close.)*

**Before any close, ensure you've done the "Loop":**
"So, do you have any other questions for me at this point?"
[Wait for answer. If none, proceed.]
"And does all of this make sense to you?"
[Wait for answer. If they reveal a new concern, address it using Conversation Aikido, then repeat the loop.]

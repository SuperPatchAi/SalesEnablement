## 1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW (Clinical Focus)

**Kick It** is Super Patch's drug-free willpower support solution, designed to help patients overcome bad habits through Vibrotactile Technology (VTT). Kick It works by activating neural pathways associated with self-control and craving modulation without pharmaceuticals or nicotine replacement.

### Clinical Mechanism of Action

Kick It's VTT works through evidence-based mechanisms:
- **Prefrontal Support:** Activates pathways associated with executive function and self-control
- **Craving Modulation:** Supports neural circuits involved in impulse management
- **Stress-Behavior Connection:** Calms nervous system pathways that trigger habitual behaviors
- **Non-Pharmacological:** No replacement therapy or pharmaceutical intervention

### Key Differentiators vs. Habit-Breaking Products

| Mechanism | Drug substitution | Chemical intervention | Neural pathway activation |
| Dependency Risk | Continued addiction | Possible | **None** |
| Drug Interactions | Some | Many | **None** |
| Side Effects | Variable | Common | **Minimal** |
| Broad Application | Smoking only | Specific habits | **Any habit** |
| Long-term Safety | Concerns | Concerns | **Excellent** |

### Practice Integration Benefits
- **Universal Application:** Supports willpower for any habit (smoking, sugar, alcohol, etc.)
- **Non-Replacement Therapy:** Doesn't substitute one substance for another
- **Supports Behavioral Work:** Enhances counseling and therapy effectiveness

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION SCRIPT (2-Minute)

**(Problem-Agitate-Solve-Evidence Framework)**

**(PROBLEM)**

"Every practitioner who works with behavior change knows the frustrating pattern: patients are motivated, they commit to change, they have all the right intentions – and then they relapse. Not because they lack willpower, but because neural patterns and stress responses are overwhelming their conscious efforts.

The tools we have are limited. Nicotine replacement just shifts addiction. Pharmaceuticals have side effects and narrow applications. And 'just use willpower' advice ignores the neuroscience of habit."

**(AGITATE)**

"This leaves your patients – and you – feeling frustrated. They blame themselves for lacking willpower when really they're fighting neural programming with insufficient support.

And the emotional toll of repeated failure makes each attempt harder. Patients lose confidence in their ability to change, and the habits that are destroying their health continue."

**(SOLVE)**

"That's why Kick It is such a valuable tool. It supports willpower and craving management through Vibrotactile Technology – activating neural pathways associated with self-control and impulse regulation.

It's not replacement therapy – there's nothing going into the body, no substance substitution. Patients still do the hard work of changing behavior, but Kick It provides neural support that helps them succeed."

**(EVIDENCE)**

"The science foundation is mechanoreceptor research that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine. The prefrontal-limbic circuits involved in self-control can be influenced through sensory pathways.

For your patients, this means additional support for the neural aspects of habit change. For your practice, it means a drug-free tool that applies to any habit – smoking, sugar, alcohol, or any behavior they're trying to change.

Would you like to integrate Kick It into your behavior change protocols?"

***

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### 1. "Habit change requires addressing root causes, not just symptoms."

**Response:** "I completely agree – understanding why someone developed a habit is essential for lasting change. Kick It isn't replacing that work.

It's supporting patients through the transition – helping them resist cravings and impulses while your therapeutic work addresses root causes. Would that supportive role be valuable?"

### 2. "How can a patch help with willpower?"

**Response:** "Good question. Self-control isn't purely psychological – it involves neural circuits, particularly prefrontal-limbic connections.

VTT activates mechanoreceptors that influence these pathways through the nervous system. It's not magic willpower, but neural support for the circuits involved in impulse control. Would understanding the mechanism in more detail be helpful?"

### 3. "My patients need proven interventions like nicotine replacement."

**Response:** "Nicotine replacement has a role, but it also maintains physical addiction. Many patients want freedom from all nicotine, not substitution.

Kick It can complement or provide an alternative to NRT – it's about giving patients options that match their goals. Do you have patients who want to quit without ongoing nicotine?"

### 4. "What about severe addictions?"

**Response:** "For severe substance use disorders, comprehensive treatment is essential. Kick It isn't a standalone solution for clinical addiction.

It's valuable for habit change – smoking, sugar, moderate alcohol use, behavioral patterns – and can support recovery as one tool among many. Would that population be relevant for your practice?"

### 5. "Patients will expect this to do the work for them."

**Response:** "That's an important expectation to manage. Kick It supports willpower – it doesn't replace the patient's effort.

Positioning it as 'neural support for the hard work you're doing' maintains patient agency and realistic expectations. How do you typically frame supportive tools with patients?"

### 6. "I haven't heard of VTT for habit change."

**Response:** "VTT for wellness is relatively new – the underlying mechanoreceptor science won the Nobel Prize in 2021.

We're applying that science to habit support through the neural pathways involved in self-control. Would you be interested in a pilot with patients to evaluate effectiveness in your practice?"

### 7. "What specific habits does this work for?"

**Response:** "That's actually Kick It's strength – it's not habit-specific. It supports the general neural pathways involved in self-control and craving management.

Whether it's smoking, sugar, alcohol, nail-biting, or any other habit, the same neural circuits are involved in behavior change. Do you work with patients on multiple types of habits?"

### 8. "Patients have tried everything and given up."

**Response:** "Those patients might actually be good candidates. Kick It works differently from anything they've tried – it's neural pathway support, not substance replacement or medication.

Sometimes a new approach reignites hope and effort. Would you like to offer it to patients who feel they've exhausted options?"

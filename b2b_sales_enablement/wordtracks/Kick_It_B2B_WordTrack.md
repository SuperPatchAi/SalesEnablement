## 3. OPENING SCRIPTS

### 1. Cold Call
"Good morning, this is [Your Name] from Super Patch. I'm reaching out because behavioral change is often the hardest part of treatment – patients know what to do but can't sustain the willpower. Our Kick It patch uses Vibrotactile Technology to support craving management and self-control – drug-free. Do you have patients who need willpower support for habit changes?"

### 2. Email Introduction
**Subject:** Drug-Free Willpower Support for Behavior Change

"Dr. [Name],

Whether it's smoking cessation, dietary compliance, or breaking other habits, willpower is often the limiting factor in patient outcomes. Pharmaceutical cessation aids have side effects, and 'try harder' isn't effective advice.

Our Kick It patch uses Vibrotactile Technology – neural pathway support for craving management and impulse control. Drug-free, no contraindications.

Would you be open to discussing how this could support your patients' behavioral change efforts?

Best regards,
[Your Name]"

## 4. DISCOVERY QUESTIONS

1. "How often do patients struggle to follow through on behavioral changes you recommend?"
2. "What's your current approach for supporting smoking cessation or other habit changes?"
3. "Do cravings and willpower challenges undermine dietary compliance in your patients?"
4. "Are patients asking for drug-free options to support their habit-breaking efforts?"
5. "Would a willpower support tool complement your behavioral change protocols?"

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION (2-Minute)

**[PROBLEM]**
"Behavioral change is often the most critical – and most difficult – part of treatment. Patients know they should quit smoking, follow dietary recommendations, or break other unhealthy habits. But willpower fails. Cravings win. And pharmaceutical cessation aids, while helpful for some, carry side effects that make many patients avoid them or discontinue."

**[SOLUTION]**
"Kick It uses Vibrotactile Technology to support the neural pathways involved in self-control and craving management. Based on Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research, it provides continuous support for willpower without pharmaceuticals, without side effects, and with broad application across any habit change.

For your practice: a drug-free tool to support behavioral compliance, 25% practitioner margin, and better patient outcomes on the changes that matter most. Would you like to trial this with patients working on habit changes?"

---

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Habit change requires counseling and behavioral support."
**Response:** "Absolutely – and Kick It complements those interventions. It's not a replacement for comprehensive cessation programs or behavioral therapy. It's additional support that helps patients follow through on the changes you're guiding. When willpower is stronger, counseling is more effective."

### "How can a patch affect willpower?"
**Response:** "VTT works through mechanoreceptor activation affecting neural pathways involved in impulse control and craving response. The prefrontal cortex and reward system are influenced by broader neural signaling, which mechanoreceptor stimulation can modulate. It's about supporting the neural infrastructure that makes self-control possible."

### "My patients need medical cessation support for serious addictions."
**Response:** "For clinical addiction, medical intervention is appropriate – and Kick It isn't a replacement. But it can complement medical treatment, and for patients with less severe habits (sugar cravings, stress eating, mild dependencies), it provides drug-free support that may be sufficient or serve as an adjunct."

### "Patients need to build willpower through practice, not products."
**Response:** "Building willpower is a process – and Kick It supports that process. Think of it as training wheels while patients develop stronger self-control. It helps them succeed early, which builds confidence and momentum for sustained change."

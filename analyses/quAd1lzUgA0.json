MAIN TOPIC & TECHNIQUE\n**Main Topic:** Relationship Building for Direct Sales Success\n**Technique:** The \"3+3+3=3000\" Model\n\n### 2. KEY FRAMEWORKS & STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS\n\n**Framework/Technique Name: The \"3+3+3=3000\" Model**\n*   **Step-by-step process:**\n    1.  **Identify 3 Current Customers:** These are people who have already purchased from you.\n    2.  **Identify 3 Potential Customers:** These are people who might be interested in your products/services in the future.\n    3.  **Identify 3 Potential Teammates:** These are people you would love to recruit to join your direct sales team.\n    4.  **Connect Daily:** The challenge is to connect with these 9 individuals *every day* (you can take a day off here and there).\n    5.  **Focus on Connection, Not Selling:** The initial connections should be genuine, conversational, and not immediately about pitching your product or business.\n*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:**\n    *   **Consistency:** Daily action builds momentum and makes relationship-building a habit.\n    *   **Volume:** 9 connections daily results in over 3,000 connections annually, significantly expanding your network and potential business opportunities exponentially.\n    *   **Authenticity:** By focusing on genuine interactions and getting to know people as individuals, you build rapport and trust, which are foundational for long-term customer relationships and team growth. People are more likely to buy from and join people they know, like, and trust.\n\n**Framework/Technique Name: Building and Utilizing a \"List of 100\"**\n*   **Step-by-step process:**\n    1.  **Create Your Initial List:** Start with a list of 100 people you know in your business (current customers, prospects, potential teammates, general network).\n    2.  **Map Out Your Week:** Plan which 3+3+3 individuals you will connect with each day from your list.\n    3.  **Continual Expansion:** Actively grow and expand this list by meeting new people through events, parties, and daily interactions (e.g., meeting moms at the playground).\n    4.  **Regular Updates:** As you connect and your network grows, consistently update and add to your list.\n*   **The psychology/principle behind why it works:**\n    *   **Structured Prospecting:** Provides a tangible and manageable list to work from, preventing analysis paralysis.\n    *   **Dynamic Growth:** Acknowledges that networking is ongoing and your list should evolve with your business growth and new relationships.\n    *   **Accountability:** Mapping out your week creates a plan for consistent outreach.\n\n### 3. EXACT SCRIPTS & WORD TRACKS\n\n*   **Opening/Relationship-Building Lines (Examples - *not* for every day, but illustrative of connection-focused messages):**\n    *   \"Hey mama, I saw your post on Instagram, it looks like you've had a rough week. I have too.\"\n    *   \"Hey, I saw you got an Instapot. I have one too. I love mine. Here's my favorite recipe I thought you might like.\"\n*   **Discovery Questions:**\n    *   *Implicitly:* Focus on \"asking questions, getting to know them as a person.\" (No explicit scripts for discovery questions are provided in this video, but the emphasis is on genuine inquiry about their lives/interests.)\n*   **Closing Phrases:**\n    *   No explicit closing phrases are provided, as the initial focus is on relationship building before any sales pitch.\n*   **Follow-up Messages:**\n    *   The video mentions \"perfectly crafted DMs, PMs, and texts\" as resources for *when* to start having business conversations, ensuring they are not \"gross\" or \"spammy.\" While specific scripts aren't provided in *this* video, the intent is to have gentle, value-added follow-ups that transition naturally from personal connection to business.\n\n### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING\n*   **Common Objections Mentioned (Implicitly):** The speaker addresses the *perception* of direct sales being \"gross,\" \"spammy,\" or \"awkward\" by advocating a relationship-first approach.\n*   **Recommended Responses/Reframe:** The video doesn't provide direct scripts for handling *specific* objections, but the entire strategy is designed to *prevent* such objections by building trust and genuine connection *before* introducing products or business opportunities. The reframe is: \"We don't want everything to be all about business... when we do [talk business], we want to make sure it's not gross, it's not spammy, it's not like out of the blue where the person is like, 'Where did this came from? What is she talking about? This is getting really awkward and I don't know if I want to continue this conversation.'\" The solution is to use \"perfectly crafted DMs, PMs, and texts\" to transition smoothly, after genuine rapport is established.\n\n### 5. KEY TAKEAWAYS\n1.  **Prioritize Relationships:** Direct sales success isn't about selling; it's about connecting with people and building genuine relationships.\n2.  **Implement the 3+3+3 Model Daily:** Consistently reach out to 3 current customers, 3 potential customers, and 3 potential teammates every day to build a network of over 3,000 connections annually.\n3.  **Connect Authentically:** Initial interactions should be conversational, empathetic, and focused on personal interests, not on pitching products or business opportunities.\n4.  **Patience is Key:** Allow relationships to develop naturally; the appropriate time to introduce your business or products will emerge once rapport and trust are established.\n5.  **Utilize a Dynamic Prospect List:** Maintain and continually grow a \"List of 100\" (or more) contacts, using it to strategically plan your daily relationship-building efforts.\n\n### 6. SUPER PATCH APPLICATION\n\nApplying the \"3+3+3=3000\" model to Super Patch wellness products would look like this:\n\n*   **3 Current Customers:**\n    *   **Connection:** \"Hey [Customer Name], just checking in! How are you doing with your [specific Super Patch product]? Are you still feeling that [benefit they experienced, e.g., improved sleep, less knee pain]?\"\n    *   **Value-add (non-salesy):** \"I just came across this great article on [related wellness topic, e.g., natural pain relief tips] and thought of you. Hope it helps!\" or \"Thinking of you - I tried a new way to place my [specific patch] the other day and it felt even better. Want me to send you a quick diagram?\"\n    *   **Psychology:** Shows you care about their well-being and product experience beyond the sale, fostering loyalty and trust.\n\n*   **3 Potential Customers:**\n    *   **Connection (based on common interests/observations):** \"Hi [Potential Customer Name], I saw your post about struggling with [common issue Super Patch addresses, e.g., afternoon slump, difficulty falling asleep]. So many of us deal with that!\" or \"I noticed you're really active with [hobby that might cause pain, e.g., gardening, running]. How are your knees feeling after all that activity?\"\n    *   **Empathy/Shared Experience:** \"I totally get it, I used to [struggle with that too/have similar aches and pains]. It can really drain you.\"\n    *   **Gentle Transition (once rapport is built over time):** \"Speaking of [problem they mentioned], I actually found something that's been a game-changer for me. It's called Super Patch, and it uses [brief benefit, e.g., vibration technology] to help with [their specific pain/energy/sleep issue]. I'm not sure if it's for you, but I'd be happy to share more if you're curious! No pressure at all.\"\n    *   **Psychology:** Establishes common ground and empathy, making you a trusted resource rather than just a salesperson. The transition is natural, offering a solution to a problem they've expressed.\n\n*   **3 Potential Teammates:**\n    *   **Connection (based on aspirations/challenges):** \"Hey [Potential Teammate Name], I've been so inspired watching your [activity/business endeavor]! You have such a great work ethic/passion for helping others.\" or \"How are things going with [their current job/life situation]? I know you mentioned wanting more [flexibility/income/purpose].\"\n    *   **Shared Vision/Opportunity (once rapport is built):** \"You know, seeing how you [positive trait/goal], it made me think of our Super Patch team. We're all about [shared values, e.g., empowering wellness, creating financial freedom] and I think you'd really resonate with our mission. It offers [benefit they desire, e.g., flexible income, a supportive community]. If you're ever open to exploring something new, I'd love to chat about it, no strings attached.\"\n    *   **Psychology:** Appeals to their goals, values, and desires, showing how the Super Patch business opportunity aligns with their personal aspirations, making them feel seen and valued."

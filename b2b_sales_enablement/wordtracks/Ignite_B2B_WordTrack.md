## 1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW (Clinical Focus)

**Ignite** is Super Patch's drug-free metabolic support solution, designed to help fire up metabolism through Vibrotactile Technology (VTT). Ignite works by activating neural pathways associated with metabolic regulation without stimulants, thermogenics, or pharmaceuticals.

### Clinical Mechanism of Action

Ignite's VTT works through evidence-based mechanisms:
- **Neural-Metabolic Pathways:** Activates pathways involved in metabolic regulation
- **Resting Metabolic Rate Support:** Supports healthy RMR without stimulant stress
- **Non-Thermogenic:** Doesn't force heat production or stress adrenals
- **Homeostatic Support:** Works with body's natural regulatory systems

### 1. Cold Call Script

"Good morning, this is [Your Name] from Super Patch. I'm reaching out to practitioners who work with patients on metabolic health and might be interested in a non-stimulant approach.

Our Ignite patch uses Vibrotactile Technology to support metabolic function through neural pathway activation – it's not a thermogenic, so there's no cardiovascular stress or adrenal depletion.

Do you have patients who need metabolic support but can't tolerate stimulants or have cardiovascular concerns?

[Listen]

Would it be helpful if I sent information on how VTT supports metabolism and how practitioners are using Ignite in weight management protocols?"

### 2. Email Introduction Script

**Subject:** Non-Stimulant Metabolic Support for Your Patients

"Dr. [Name],

Metabolic support is a top patient request, but most products are stimulant-based – stressing cardiovascular and adrenal systems while producing temporary effects.

Our Ignite patch offers a different approach:
- VTT supports metabolic pathways through neural activation
- No stimulants, no thermogenics, no cardiovascular stress
- Safe for patients with heart conditions or adrenal fatigue
- Based on Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research

For your practice, this means:

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION SCRIPT (2-Minute)

**(Problem-Agitate-Solve-Evidence Framework)**

**(PROBLEM)**

"Metabolic health is a top patient concern – whether it's weight management, energy, or overall vitality. But the product landscape is dominated by stimulants and thermogenics that create as many problems as they solve.

Caffeine-based fat burners, ephedrine analogs, and thermogenic compounds all work by stressing the system – forcing heat production, spiking heart rate, depleting adrenals. These aren't sustainable solutions."

**(AGITATE)**

"For your patients who already have cardiovascular concerns, adrenal fatigue, or anxiety, these products are completely off-limits. And even for healthier patients, the side effects – jitters, insomnia, crashes – undermine the quality of life improvements they're seeking.

Meanwhile, you're working on root causes – addressing insulin resistance, thyroid function, hormone balance – but patients want additional metabolic support while those interventions take effect."

**(SOLVE)**

"That's why Ignite is so valuable. It supports metabolic function through Vibrotactile Technology – neural pathway activation rather than stimulant forcing.

There's nothing entering the body, no thermogenic stress, no cardiovascular load. Patients simply apply the patch, and the specialized ridge patterns activate neural pathways involved in metabolic regulation. It works with the body's homeostatic systems rather than overriding them."

**(EVIDENCE)**

"The science foundation is mechanoreceptor research that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine. The neural-metabolic connection is well-documented – nervous system signaling influences metabolic rate.

For your patients, this means metabolic support without the tradeoffs of stimulant-based products. For your practice, it means a safe tool that complements your comprehensive approach to metabolic health.

Would you like to integrate Ignite into your metabolic protocols?"

***

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### 1. "Real metabolic change requires diet and exercise, not a patch."

**Response:** "I completely agree – diet, exercise, and addressing root causes are foundational. Ignite isn't replacing any of that.

It's an additional tool for patients who are doing the work but need extra support, or who have metabolic dysfunction that makes early progress difficult. It's about enabling your treatment plan. Does that positioning resonate?"

### 2. "How can a patch affect metabolism without being stimulant?"

**Response:** "Great question. The mechanism is neural pathway activation – VTT stimulates mechanoreceptors connected to metabolic regulatory pathways.

Rather than forcing thermogenesis through chemicals, it supports the nervous system's role in metabolic regulation. It's working with homeostatic systems, not overriding them. Would understanding the mechanism in more detail be helpful?"

### 3. "My patients expect dramatic weight loss results."

**Response:** "That expectation is set by stimulant marketing, and it's unrealistic for sustainable health. Ignite isn't a magic weight loss product.

It supports metabolic function as part of a comprehensive approach. Setting realistic expectations – that Ignite supports metabolism while diet, exercise, and other interventions do the heavy lifting – leads to better outcomes and patient satisfaction. How do you typically manage weight loss expectations?"

### 4. "What specific metabolic improvement can patients expect?"

**Response:** "Because Ignite works through neural pathway support rather than forced stimulation, effects are supportive rather than dramatic.

Patients often report feeling like their metabolism is more 'responsive' to their efforts. Rather than promising specific numbers, I'd suggest trialing with patients and assessing their overall progress. Would that approach work?"

### 5. "Patients with metabolic issues often have complex conditions."

**Response:** "Exactly – which is why stimulant-based products are often contraindicated for them. Ignite's advantage is safety.

No cardiovascular stress, no adrenal depletion, no drug interactions. It can be used alongside your other interventions without complicating their care. Does that fit with your patient population?"

### 6. "This seems like a lot for just metabolic support."

**Response:** "The value is in what it doesn't do – it doesn't stress the heart, deplete adrenals, cause anxiety, or disrupt sleep.

For patients who can't use typical metabolic support products, the value is significant. And for practitioners, having a safe tool for complex patients is valuable. How often do you have patients with metabolic concerns who can't use standard products?"

### 7. "Insurance won't cover this."

**Response:** "You're right – Ignite is out-of-pocket. Patients invested in their metabolic health are often willing to invest in safe tools.

The cost compares favorably to many supplement protocols, and there are no side effects requiring additional management. How do your patients typically respond to wellness investments?"

### 8. "I'd need to see research on metabolic effects specifically."

**Response:** "I understand wanting specific evidence. The mechanism – VTT and neural-metabolic pathways – is based on established science.

The best way to evaluate Ignite is trialing with appropriate patients and observing their progress alongside your other interventions. Would a pilot approach work for your practice?"

## 3. OPENING SCRIPTS

### 1. Cold Call Script

"Good morning, this is [Your Name] from Super Patch. I'm reaching out to sports medicine practitioners about a drug-free performance enhancement option for athletes.

Our Victory patch uses Vibrotactile Technology – it's completely clean for drug testing while supporting strength, speed, and agility through neural pathway optimization.

Do you work with athletes who are looking for a legal competitive edge beyond nutrition and training?

[Listen]

Would it be helpful if I sent information on the VTT mechanism and how it's being used in athletic performance settings?"

### 2. Email Introduction Script

**Subject:** Drug Testing Safe Performance Option for Your Athletes

"[Name],

Athletes constantly seek performance edges, but recommending anything carries risk. Banned substances, variable supplement quality, and unknown long-term effects make it challenging to offer safe enhancement options.

Our Victory patch provides a clean alternative:
- 100% drug testing safe – nothing goes into the body
- VTT optimizes neuromuscular pathways for performance
- No stimulants, no banned substances, no crash
- Based on Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research

For your practice, this means:
✓ A performance tool you can recommend with confidence
✓ Zero risk to athlete eligibility
✓ Enhancement without liability concerns
✓ 25% practitioner discount

Would a brief call to discuss how Victory fits into your athlete care work?

Best regards,
[Your Name]"

### 3. LinkedIn/Social Media Outreach Script

"Hi [Name],

I noticed your work in [sports medicine/athletic training/etc.]. I wanted to connect about drug-free performance enhancement.

We've developed a VTT-based solution that supports athletic performance without substances – completely clean for drug testing. Many practitioners in sports medicine are using it as a legal edge for their athletes.

Would you be interested in learning about the technology? It's a different approach than supplements or stimulants.

[Your Name]"

### 4. Referral Introduction Script

"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Super Patch. [Referrer] suggested I reach out – they've been using our Victory patches with their athletes and thought your practice would benefit.

They mentioned you work with [competitive athletes/college sports/etc.] where drug testing is a concern. Is finding clean performance solutions a challenge you face?

[Listen]

Great. Victory has been valuable for practitioners who can't recommend typical pre-workout products. Would you like information on the mechanism?"

### 5. Conference/Networking Event Script

"Hi, I'm [Your Name] with Super Patch. Do you work with athletes seeking performance enhancement?

[If yes:] Then you know how challenging it is to recommend anything that's both effective and clean. Our Victory patch uses Vibrotactile Technology – completely drug testing safe – to support strength, speed, and agility through neural pathway optimization.

Would you be interested in learning more about how practitioners are using it in sports medicine?"

## 5. PRODUCT PRESENTATION SCRIPT (2-Minute)

**(Problem-Agitate-Solve-Evidence Framework)**

**(PROBLEM)**

"Every athlete wants an edge. They see competitors using supplements, pre-workouts, and performance enhancers and feel they're falling behind. But as a practitioner, you face a dilemma – you can't recommend products with banned substance risk, uncertain ingredient quality, or unknown long-term effects.

The gap between what athletes want and what you can safely recommend is frustrating for both of you."

**(AGITATE)**

"This isn't just about performance – it's about athlete safety and your professional liability. One contaminated supplement or unknown ingredient could end a career and create legal exposure for you.

And the 'clean' options like caffeine come with their own problems – jitters, crashes, sleep disruption, and anxiety. Young athletes are particularly vulnerable to pressure to use substances. You need something that works and is unquestionably safe."

**(SOLVE)**

"That's why Victory is so valuable. It provides performance enhancement through Vibrotactile Technology – neuromuscular pathway optimization rather than chemical intervention.

There's nothing going into the body – no substances, no transdermal delivery, nothing to test positive for. Athletes wear the patch, and the specialized ridge patterns enhance communication between nervous system and muscles for improved strength, speed, and agility."

**(EVIDENCE)**

"The science foundation is the same mechanoreceptor research that won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine. VTT activates neural pathways through touch receptors – it's a legitimate mechanism, not a gimmick.

For your athletes, this means a clean competitive edge you can recommend with confidence. For your practice, it means differentiating with innovation while eliminating risk.

Would you like to trial Victory with your athletes and evaluate the results?"

***

## 6. OBJECTION HANDLING

### 1. "Athletes need real performance enhancement, not a patch."

**Response:** "I understand the skepticism – athletes expect measurable results. The mechanism is real though: VTT optimizes neuromuscular pathways through mechanoreceptor activation.

It's not magic, but it's legitimate enhancement without substances. Would you be open to a pilot with a few athletes to evaluate their experience?"

### 2. "How can I trust this is actually drug testing safe?"

**Response:** "That's the right question to ask. Victory doesn't deliver anything into the body – it works through neural pathway activation via touch receptors.

There's nothing to test positive for because there are no substances. It's as clean as wearing a compression garment. Does understanding the mechanism address the concern?"

### 3. "My athletes already use pre-workout – why would they switch?"

**Response:** "Pre-workout works for some athletes, but many experience jitters, crashes, or sleep disruption. And there's always ingredient uncertainty.

Victory can complement or replace pre-workout depending on the athlete. It provides clean energy and performance support without the downsides. Would it be valuable as an alternative for athletes who don't tolerate stimulants well?"

### 4. "What specific performance improvements can athletes expect?"

**Response:** "VTT supports neuromuscular optimization – that translates to potential improvements in strength, speed, agility, and reaction time. Individual results vary based on the athlete and sport.

Rather than promising specific percentages, I'd suggest trialing it with athletes and measuring their actual performance metrics. Would that approach work for your practice?"

### 5. "This seems expensive compared to supplements."

**Response:** "When you factor in the true cost of supplements – including risk of contamination, unknown ingredients, and potential career-ending positive tests – the value equation changes.

Victory provides clean performance support with zero risk. What's the value of protecting an athlete's eligibility and career? How do you typically approach cost conversations with athletes about performance products?"

### 6. "I need to see more research before recommending this."

**Response:** "I appreciate that evidence-based approach. The underlying technology is based on Nobel Prize-winning mechanoreceptor research – the science is solid.

What would help: trialing Victory with a few athletes and measuring their performance metrics directly. That way you have your own data from your athlete population. Would that work?"

### 7. "How is this different from other wearable performance products?"

**Response:** "Good question. Many wearables claim performance benefits through compression or placebo. Victory works through a specific, documented mechanism – Vibrotactile Technology activating mechanoreceptors.

The Nobel Prize connection isn't marketing – it's the actual science foundation. Would understanding the mechanism difference in more detail be helpful?"

### 8. "Athletes are skeptical – they've tried gimmicks before."

**Response:** "That skepticism is earned – the market is full of products that don't deliver. The best response to skepticism is results.

Let athletes try Victory and measure their own performance. If it works, they'll continue. If it doesn't meet their expectations, no harm done. Would a trial approach work for your athlete population?"
